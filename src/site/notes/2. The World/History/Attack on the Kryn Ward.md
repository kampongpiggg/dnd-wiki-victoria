And the beasts of the Reach... well, they're hardly capable of running our machines. If demand doesn't increase, I fear we may have to scale down production at the forges.

**The Attack on the Kryn Ward** was a terrorist attack that occured in the capital of Ophidia in 752 AY. A runepowder bomb that was planted outside of the Black Hound, a local tavern in [[2. The World/Locations/The Kryn Ward\|The Kryn Ward]], exploded, instantly killing 52 and injuring 72 others. The district was damaged severely by the bomb. The bomb, planted by [[../Organisations/The High Syndicacy \| Syndicacy]] agents [[2. The World/People/Velissa & Vexalia\|Velissa & Vexalia]] on the orders of [[../People/Ovina Torunn \| Chancellor Ovina Torunn]], led to the death of the Archmage [[2. The World/People/Maribel Merewyn\|Maribel Merewyn]] and [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]]'s entry into [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]].

##  Background
By 752 AY, a brutal stalemate between [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]] and [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]], the two major sides of The Sundering War, was reached. Both sides had sustained massive losses over the three years of fighting. Additionally, it was discovered that the Rarquet Assembly had been selling weapons to both sides, profiting off the war. In a fit of rage, the [[../People/Eleanor Hamilton \| Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton]] refused to buy more from Rarquet.

As possible talks of peace surfaced, the High Syndicacy convened a council to deliberate on the matter. It was then Chancellor Ovina planned for the attack, tasking elven Syndicacy agents Velissa & Vexalia to bomb the Kryn Ward. The intent was to frame the Republic and facilitate Ophidia's entry into the Sundering War, which would have provided Rarquet with a new client.

## Attack
At fifteen past noon, Velissa and Vexalia entered the gates of the Kryn Ward in a carriage, which contained the runepowder bomb in a trick compartment. Undetected, they left the carriage outside the famed local tavern the Black Hound, before leaving. Their presence was detected by the High Mage Felicity, who had been accompanying her mentor the Archmage Maribel Merewyn to the Black Hound for a community event. She pursued the twins, leading to an altercation. Whilst the twins escaped, the High Mage was able to cut off a lock of Vexalia's hair.

At twenty past one, the bomb detonated. It instantly killed everyone in the tavern, and released a powerful shockwave that injured everyone in a sixty feet radius. This led to the death of the human Archmage Maribel Merewyn. The Ophidian Herald speculated that "many more would have been killed or injured if the bomb had gone off minutes later." The bomb destroyed the entirety of the tavern and parts of the surrounding shops. Wooden carriages were set alight in the aftermath of the explosion.

By two, the City Watch arrived on scene and began search and rescue; alas, due to the force of the explosion, there were no survivors within the building.

## Arrest and Interrogation
With a lock of Vexalia's hair, the High Mage was able to scry on the location of the twins. They were found fleeing back on horseback back towards Rarquet, and arrested immediately. During the interrogation, which lasted for two weeks, the twins ultimately revealed that they had been working on the orders of Chancellor Ovina; witnesses claim that the twins had requested for a fair trial and clemency for their actions, but were executed summarily by the High Mage.

## Aftermath
The death of the Archmage Maribel left a vacancy in the Ring of Gold, which was filled by the High Mage Felicity. The attack also forced [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]]'s entry into the war, as they sought vengeance against Rarquet.
