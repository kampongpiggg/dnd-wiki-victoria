**Operation Chisel** was a planned military operation by [[2. The World/Organisations/Force Grey\|Force Grey]], [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]]'s elite military unit. Led by [[2. The World/People/Felicity\| the Archmage Felicity]] as a direct response to the [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\|Attack on the Kryn Ward]], its primary objective was the destruction of forges and smiths capable of producing the devastating automatons used by the [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]] in [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]]. It had a secondary objective in capturing or killing the Rarquet head-of-state, [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\| Ovina Torunn]] of the [[2. The World/Organisations/The High Syndicacy\|The High Syndicacy]].

## Background
In 752 AY, the Rarquet Assembly staged a false flag operation to draw Ophidia into the Sundering War. Chancellor Ovina Torunn had instructed her agents, the elven twins [[2. The World/People/Velissa & Vexalia\|Velissa & Vexalia]] to attack the Ophidian capital, as their entry into the war meant a greater demand for arms, armour and automatons. While the twins succeeded in their mission, they were apprehended by the High Mage Felicity. The twins revealed their sponsor after a fortnight-long interrogation.

Whilst the entry of Ophidia into the Sundering War provided a massive boon, with Republic and Assembly forces pushed out from the cities they were occupying, Alastia and Ophidia had insufficient forces for a counteroffensive. In response, the Ring of Gold began plotting a new operation: Force Grey was tasked to scout behind enemy lines and identify sites that would facilitate this effort.

After a year of scouting, Force Grey was able to map out the supply routes as well as key forges and smiths used by the Assembly to provide continuous firepower to the frontlines. In an effort to cripple Rarquet and Cer'Dorei, it was decided by the Ring of Gold that a simultaneous assault on all the forges and smiths was needed to prevent the Assembly's recovery. Places of strategic value were identified and split up: [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\| Alastian sorcerers]], the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Silver\|Ring of Silver]] and the Ring of Brass were tasked with destroying critical objectives around Rarquet, while Force Grey was entrusted with the capture or neutralisation of Chancellor Ovina Torunn.

## Assault
At three in the morning, battle erupted all around the nation of Rarquet. The combined effort of Alastian sorcerers as well as the mages from the Ring of Silver and Ring of Brass allowed for the simultaneous assault and destruction of forges all around the nation. Witness accounts reported that the battles were swift, decisive and incredibly deadly - many forges and smiths were on fire even before a response was mounted. While most mages left after the objective was accomplished, some stayed till it was secured. It was alleged that in spite of the destruction of the forges and smiths some sorcerers stayed back to slaughter the responding guards. By six in the morning, most of Rarquet's military might had been decimated.

In Dunhammer, Force Grey assaulted the Citadel. While Syndicacy agents protecting the stronghold had mounted a layered defense, the element of surprise enabled Force Grey to break and rush through many barriers. A tense battle erupted in the High Hall of the Citadel, which ended in the deaths of many Syndicacy agents. Force Grey reported that the Chancellor refused surrender, and erupted into the High Hall in a massive mech suit powered by the Ether. The fight waged on for ten minutes before the Archmage Felicity's *Dark Star* spell crushed the Chancellor, disintegrating her.

## Aftermath 
A critically successful operation, the destruction of forges and smith as well as the death of the Chancellor Ovina resulted in the paralysis of the Rarquet war machine. Many historians agree that this was a lynchpin event in the Sundering War, stressing that the failure of this operation likely would have gravely changed the geopolitics of the continent. 

Renewed by a sense of hope, Alastians and Ophidias alike set their sights on [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\| a final counteroffensive.]]
