**The Siege of Dashund's Lea** was a critical military engagement during the early stages of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]]. Republic forces led by [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Imperator Julian Yaeldrin]] besieged the city of [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]], a critical chokepoint by which the [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\| Alastian]] supply lines to the front flowed. After two days of fighting, the Republic forces broke through the walls, razing the city. The city's fall marked a key point in [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]] as [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]] gained the upper hand.

## Background
After the succession crisis in the Kingdom of Alastia and the subsequent declaration of a national emergency by [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]], Imperator Julian Yaeldrin led his forces in a brutal and rapid advance into Alastia. In just the first few months, they were able to capture cities up till the River Vrosh, occupying a third of Alastian territories. This was primarily made possible by the exceptional discipline of the Legion - the Republic's well-trained military - as well as the powerful automatons provided by the Rarquet Assembly. 

However, seeking to profit from the war, the Rarquet Assembly began sale of arms, armour and automatons to Alastia as well, a move that albeit stalled the Republic advance. This stalemate went on for four months as each side suffered attrition with no ground gain. Mounting pressure from the Senate began as fears of a counter-attack began to grow. 

In a decisive bid to circumvent this, Imperator Julian Yaeldrin led a contingent of 300 soldiers to lay siege to [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]], bypassing multiple, larger cities along the way so as to deny the continued supply of food and arms to the frontlines.

## The Siege
To avoid detection, which would have led to either magical bombardment or protracted battle with the Alastians, Imperator Julian Yaeldrin decided to close in on Dashund's Lea speedily and stealthily. As moving with speed and stealth were his priorities, he reportedly left behind cannons and a large majority of his automatons. Instead, he chose a small contingent of 300 Legionnaires and ten Ether-powered ballistae and took the Portway, which was the fastest route of advance to Dashund's Lea. 

It was reported that a barrage of magical blasts was what woke the city up. The Alastian guards, taken aback by the sudden arrival of Republic forces so deep in their homeland, scrambled to muster; survivors reported just closing the gates in time. For two days wave after wave of bolts rained down upon the city walls. Any attempt to send word out for aid was stopped: carrier pigeons were shot out of the sky, messengers were caught and slaughtered publicly before the walls. *Sending* spells were cast, and yet stopped for reasons still unknown.

## The Fall of Dashund's Lea
After two days of constant bombardment, the city walls finally gave way; with a deafening roar, the Imperator and his 300 men charged into the city, sacking it in a brutal fashion. Almost all of the defenders of the City were executed. By the time the Alastians knew Dashund's Lea had fallen, the majority of the Republic military had already caught up, fortifying themselves within the city.

The fall of Dashund's Lea marked a critical point in the Sundering War as the Republic not only broke the year-long stalemate, but cemented an advantage that would put them ahead for much of the war.
