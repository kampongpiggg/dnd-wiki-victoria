**The Siege of Dashund's Lea** was a critical military engagement during the early stages of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]]. Republic forces led by [[Julian Yaeldrin \| Imperator Julian Yaeldrin]] besieged the city of [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]], a critical chokepoint by which the [[The Kingdom of Alastia \| Alastian]] supply lines to the front flowed. After weeks of fighting, the Republic forces broke through the walls, razing the city and killing much of its population. The city's fall marked a key point in [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]] as [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]] gained the upper hand.

## Background
After the succession crisis in the Kingdom of Alastia and the subsequent declaration of a national emergency by [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]], Imperator Julian Yaeldrin led his forces in a brutal and rapid advance into Alastia. In just the first few months, they were able to capture cities up till the River Vrosh, occupying a third of Alastian territories. This was primarily made possible by the exceptional discipline of the Legion - the Republic's well-trained military - as well as the powerful automatons provided by the Rarquet Assembly. 

However, seeking to profit from the war, the Rarquet Assembly began sale of arms, armour and automatons to Alastia as well, a move that albeit stalled the Republic advance. This stalemate went on for four months as each side suffered attrition with no ground gain. Mounting pressure from the Senate began as fears of a counter-attack began to grow. 

In a decisive bid to circumvent this, Imperator Julian Yaeldrin led a contingent of 300 soldiers to lay siege to Dashund's Lea, bypassing multiple, larger cities along the way so as to deny the continued supply of food and arms to the frontlines.
