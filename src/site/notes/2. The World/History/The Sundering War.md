**The Sundering War**, also known as the **War of Mace and Wings**, was a major multi-theater international conflict across the continent. In essence, it was a war between [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]] and [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]], sparked by tensions arising from a succession crisis in Alastia. As the war escalated, both sides sought allies to gain an edge over the other, eventually embroiling the continent in full-blown conflict.

## Opening Moves
The conflict began in 749 ADY, orchestrated by [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Senator Julian Yaeldrin of Cer'Dorei]] and [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\| Chancellor Ovina Torunn]] of [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]]. Tensions arose between Alastia and Cer'Dorei following the assassination of the [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\| Alsatian King Arthur Hamilton]] by elven assassins [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\| Vaxildan and Vexalia]], sent by Julian and Ovina who ignited the war for power and profit respectively. His throne, by the laws of succession, was to pass to his wife, the half-elf [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\| Queen Gwendolyn Hamilton]]. However, his mother the [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\| Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton]], who already personally disliked Queen Gwendolyn, used this opportunity to decry her daughter-in-law's elven heritage and seize power. 

Upon the violation of the laws of succession, Julian used his influence in [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]] to declare a national emergency, approve the foreign intervention to back Queen Gwendolyn and install himself as Imperator. Ovina also ramps up production of magical arms, armour and automatons, selling to Cer'Dorei to support this war effort. Covertly, she reaches out to Alastia, and began selling magical arms and armour as well. 

## Gaining an Edge
After the loss of [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]] in [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\|The Siege of Dashund's Lea]], noble human houses began experimenting with exposure to various cosmic forces, sometimes copulating with them. This was a high risk gamble that paid off, granting these houses and [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\| their future descendants]] powerful sorcerous abilities. This turned the tide of the battle momentarily, resulting in heavy losses in the Cer'Dorei Republic. 

In response, the Imperator sent out diplomats into [[2. The World/Locations/The Verdant Reach\|The Verdant Reach]], treating with various warlords to enlist them into his war effort. [[2. The World/Organisations/The Russett Pride\|The Russett Pride]] responded, joining the Cer'Dorei upon promise that the powerful Cer'Dorei legions would help them conquer the Reach after the war. This prompted [[2. The World/Organisations/Clan Ladon\|Clan Ladon]] to enter the war, joining Alastia.

## Breaking the Stalemate
By 752 AY, a brutal stalemate was reached, with massive losses on both sides. As possible talks of peace surfaced, Chancellor Ovina [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\| sent agents into the Kryn Ward, bombing it with a powerful arcane device]]. This led to the death of the human archmage [[2. The World/People/Maribel Merewyn\| Maribel Merewyn]], an Archmage of the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]]. This forced [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]] to enter the war, aligning with Alastia and seeking vengeance against Rarquet. 

The entry of Ophidia turns the tide of the war, resulting in the destruction of key forges and smiths supporting the war effort. Most importantly, in 754 AY, [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\| an assault on the Assembly capital]] led by the [[2. The World/People/Felicity\| Archmage Felicity]], Maribel's former protege, the elite strike team known as [[2. The World/Organisations/Force Grey\|Force Grey]] kills Chancellor Ovina.

##  The Fall of the Dowager Queen
![war_five_queens.jpg](/img/user/z_Attachments/war_five_queens.jpg)
Now on the cusp of victory, the Dowager Queen vowed to lead the final assault into the Republic; she mustered her forces, placing them under the command of [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\| General Victorian Parcival]], and began the march on Cer'Dorei. While they win battles and territories along the way, the Dowager Queen only made it halfway before she took ill. Unbeknownst to her, she had been poisoned gradually by her vassal house - the Tychonis - who wanted to install a new leader that was less paranoid and aggressive. When she dies along the journey, the war council crowns Victoria as her replacement. 

The war finally comes to a brutal end in 755 AY, as the combined might of the Alastians, the Ophidians and Clan Ladon defeats the Imperator in the field outside of [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]]. It is estimated that the Sundering War wiped out 30 to 45% of the population on the Leucaria continent.

## Aftermath - Establishment of the Concord
After the end of the war, to prevent a future war, a Concord was reached: the nations would form [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\| a combined empire]], unifying under a central government administered by [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]]. Each nation would also levy 30% of their taxes and 50% of their armies to the empire to bolster recovery and, more urgently, keep continental peace. A new law of succession regarding the Victorian Emperor was also passed - successors are not chosen by bloodlines, but instead by the previous Emperor. There are, however, several legal restrictions on who is eligible to inherit the throne: first, candidates must be a sovereign ruler of one of the nations in the Empire; no child of an Emperor is eligible; and no citizen of the current Emperor's nation is eligible. This ensures a rotation of power amongst the nations, which was the key factor in unification. The Empire was then named after its first Emperor, the hero of the Concord, General Victoria Percival.

## Key Combatants
### Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton
The human queen of the Kingdom of Alastia, Eleanor Hamilton was deeply nationalistic and antagonistic towards the elves. She deeply disapproved of the marriage between her son Arthur Hamilton and her half-elf daughter-in-law, Gwendolyn Hamilton, often insulting Gwendolyn's elven heritage. She came into power after seizing the throne upon King Arthur 's assassination by elven assassins. This was widely considered a contentious move, as the laws of succession meant that the throne would pass rightfully to the Queen Gwendolyn. She was primarily backed by her vassal houses, the nobles who would one day become the Chamber of Lords-Advisory. She was eventually assassinated by them, who sought to replace her with a more stable leader.

### Senator Julian Yaeldrin
A grasper from a minor noble house, Julian Yaeldrin's heroic efforts in defending the Cer'Dorei Republic against the raids of tribes in the Verdant Reach earned him great renown. He levied his storied and decorated military service into a political career in the Cervine Senate, where his informal alliance with [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]] and [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] as the First Triumvirate dominated politics. 

During the succession crisis of Alastia, Julian convinced the Senate to invade and back Queen Gwendolyn as the rightful queen, citing the need for intervention to ensure heads-of-state are held accountable to the same laws their people were subject to. With Khan the Younger and Pompeia Ganamede's aid, Senator Julian Yaeldrin declares a national emergency and is installed as the Imperator. He led them to victory at the Siege of Dashund's Lea, capturing the key settlement that enabled trade and supplies for Alastia's war effort. He was ultimately killed in battle outside Syllamere, against the combined might of the Alastians, Ophidians and Clan Ladon.

### Chancellor Ovina Torunn
Chancellor Ovina Torunn leads the [[2. The World/Organisations/The High Syndicacy\|The High Syndicacy]], a council of guild-leaders who run the Rarquet Assembly more like a business than a state. While Rarquet produces a wide variety of finished products, from bags of holding to carriage wagons, their most profitable trade remained magical arms, armour, and automatons. To bolster their strength, Ovina conspires with Julian Yaeldrin to assassinate King Arthur and trigger a war. During the war, she sells to both sides, profiting greatly.

In a bid to continue the war in 752 AY, she sanctioned the assault on Ophidia's Kryn Ward, resulting in the death of the Archmage Meribel Merewyn. Ovina was eventually killed in an assault led the Archmage Felicity, who succeeded her mentor's position.

### War Chief Hralvok
Unlike other states, the Verdant Reach was a wild, fractured place. Various tribes vie for power over one another in this lawless land. As the war progressed, different sides sought to contact different tribes, recruiting them into the war to try and break the stalemate. The beastfolk tribes were consolidated into two major sides: Clan Ladon, led by War Chief Hralvok, and the Russet Pride, led by Skald Qreqerr.

During the battle outside Syllamere, Hralvok slays Qreqerr in single combat. The dragonborn was subsequently nominated as the leader of the Reach during the establishment of the Concord.

### The Archmage Felicity
Originally a protege of the human Archmage Maribel Merewyn and arcane researcher in the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Silver\|Ring of Silver]], the attack on the Kryn Ward by Syndicacy agents led to the death of Felicity's mentor. Assuming her mentor's station, Felicity was the tiebreaking vote for Ophidia's entry into the war, and led a direct assault against the Syndicacy. She succeeded in her quest to avenge her mentor, killing the Chancellor Ovina.
