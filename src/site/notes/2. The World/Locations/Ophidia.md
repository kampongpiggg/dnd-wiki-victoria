**Ophidia** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the western seaboard, Ophidia is an extremely advanced technological and magical state who often advocates for the freedom of science and the arcane arts. They are ruled by the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]]. 

Interestingly, their capital city is also called Ophidia.

## Description
Ophidia is a highly advanced realm; the magocracy had beautiful prismatic spires, ornate streetlamps and pristine cobblestones in its streets. Much of its population lives concentrated around the four cities, but it was not uncommon to see isolated wizard towers all throughout the land. 

Its most notable feature is the Forest of the Fae, where the defeat of the Baba Yaga by the gods left behind incredible stores of Ether that had enriched the forest; as a result, wild magic surges are commonplace in the forest. The battle saw the banishment of the Baba Yaga into the dimension that would grow to become the Feywild and left behind a massive crater that some claim is a doorway to the lost realm. 

A land rooted in magic, Ophidians have incredible arcane power. Despite the small size of their nation, the state is responsible for much of the scientific and arcane advancement of the continent.  

## Government
Ophidia is a magocracy, ruled by the council known as the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]]. The Ring was made up of eight archmages, each an unparalleled master in a school of wizardry. 

Each Archmage was staffed with two apprentices, known as High Mages. When an Archmage dies, he or she is succeeded by one of the two apprentices. The collective circle of sixteen apprentices were known as the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Silver\|Ring of Silver]], who were some of the most powerful mages in the state. Entry into the Ring of Silver is one of the most selective processes in the world, requiring the participants to not only ace an extremely academically rigorous examination but also passing an intense gauntlet of physical combat. 

In turn, once appointed, the sixteen apprentices hold ministries and courts of their own, each of varying size. This was known colloquially as the Ring of Brass, although no such official documentation exists. The Ring of Brass is responsible for the management of daily affairs, such as taxation.
