**Ophidia** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the western seaboard, Ophidia is an extremely advanced technological and magical state who often advocates for the freedom of science and the arcane arts. They are ruled by the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]]. 

Interestingly, their capital city is also called Ophidia.

## Description
Ophidia is a highly advanced realm; the magocracy had beautiful prismatic spires, ornate streetlamps and pristine cobblestones in its streets. Much of its population lives concentrated around the four cities, but it was not uncommon to see isolated wizard towers all throughout the land. 

Its most notable feature is the Forest of the Fae, where the defeat of the Baba Yaga by the gods left behind incredible stores of Ether that had enriched the forest; as a result, wild magic surges are commonplace in the forest. The battle saw the banishment of the Baba Yaga into the dimension that would grow to become the Feywild and left behind a massive crater that some claim is a doorway to the lost realm. 

A land rooted in magic, Ophidians have incredible arcane power. Despite the small size of their nation, the state is responsible for much of the scientific and arcane advancement of the continent.  

## Government
Ophidia is a magocracy, ruled by the council known as the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]]. The Ring was made up of eight archmages, each an unparalleled master in a school of wizardry. 

Each Archmage was staffed with two apprentices, known as High Mages. When an Archmage dies, he or she is succeeded by one of the two apprentices. The collective circle of sixteen apprentices were known as the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Silver\|Ring of Silver]], who were some of the most powerful mages in the state. Entry into the Ring of Silver is one of the most selective processes in the world, requiring the participants to not only ace an extremely academically rigorous examination but also passing an intense gauntlet of physical combat. 

In turn, once appointed, the sixteen apprentices hold ministries and courts of their own, each of varying size. This was known colloquially as the Ring of Brass, although no such official documentation exists. The Ring of Brass is responsible for the management of daily affairs, such as taxation.

## Culture
A place of enlightenment, Ophidians hold freedom very closely to their hearts. They seek freedom and knowledge with a thirst unlike any other nation, and are often wiling to test the limits of arcane power.

Religion is practiced in the nation, but to an extremely small extent. While not persecuted legally, most citizens see religion as a distraction from learning about the world, and often looked down on those who professed that the gods have all the answers. Thus, worship is often in secret or quiet.

## History
During the initial outbreak of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]], while Ophidia condemned the coup of the Dowager Queen and the subsequent invasion by the Republic, they remained neutral in the war. However, after the [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\|Attack on the Kryn Ward]] which saw the death of the Archmage [[2. The World/People/Maribel Merewyn\|Maribel Merewyn]], Ophidia decided to enter the war, siding with [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]] against [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]] and [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]]. 

The entry into Ophidia into the Sundering War facilitated the liberation of Ryoko and Coatlan, driving out Republic and Assembly forces from the cities they were occupying. In secret, the Ring of Gold also tasked [[2. The World/Organisations/Force Grey\|Force Grey]] to began preparations for a [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\| covert military operation]].

After the success of Operation Chisel, a key military operation that saw the crippling of the Republic war effort and the exit of Rarquet from the Sundering War, the Archmage [[2. The World/People/Felicity\| Felicity]] led Force Grey and an Ophidian army on the march to [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]]. While the march was successful in ending the war through the death of the Imperator [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]], the Archmage Felicity was felled in battle by the Skald Qreqerr.

Ophidia was also a key nation in ratifying the details for the Concord; having been a voice of peace since the start of the war, many of her mages in the Ring of Silver ascended to key positions in the Imperial Army, a coalition force forged from the armies of each nation, so as to enforce the peace.

## Trade
As a magically advanced nation, Ophidia imports a substantial amount of gems and other material spell components for her research and development. They, in turn, export finished magical items and artifacts to the rest of the continent.

Notably, they produce a substantial amount of scientific and arcane literature; rivalled only by the Hexeverel in the capital.

## Transportation
Like most major cities, public and private transportation in the form of drays, coaches and carriages were available. Notably in Ophidia, massive mindless automatons - known as bisons - travel with preset routes throughout the cities., ferrying people along the main boulevards.

A network of teleportation circles is rumored to exist within and across the cities, allowing the Ring of Gold and the Ring of Silver to travel quickly to places of import.

## Defenses
Ophidia has two major military forces; the Ophidian Army and the Arcane Marshals. The Ophidian Army is the general purpose military, responsible not only for national defense but also serve as the local police force to control petty crime like theft and murder. 

The Arcane Marshals take on more dangerous crimes; as the primary vocation in the nation and her cities is wizardry, the Arcane Marshals investigate crimes of incredible magical significance. They act as law enforcement against crime of high magic and defends the cities against supernatural threats. They also police the use of arcane magic, and ensure magic that is outlawed is not practiced.

While some of her cities are walled, some are not. Instead, these cities are powered with an pylon defense system; streetlamps placed strategically around the cities can be activated to project powerful blasts of electricity to incapacitate an invading force.
