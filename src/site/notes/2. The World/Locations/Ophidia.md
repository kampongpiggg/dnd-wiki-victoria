**Ophidia** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the western seaboard, Ophidia is an extremely advanced technological and magical state who often advocates for the freedom of science and the arcane arts. They are ruled by the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]]. 

Interestingly, their capital city is also called Ophidia.

## Description
Ophidia is a highly advanced realm; the magocracy had beautiful prismatic spires and pristine cobblestones in its streets. Much of its population lives concentrated around the four cities, but it was not uncommon to see isolated wizard towers all throughout the land. 

Its most notable feature is the Forest of the Fae, where the defeat of the Baba Yaga by the gods left behind incredible stores of Ether that had enriched the forest; as a result, wild magic surges are commonplace in the forest. The battle saw the banishment of the Baba Yaga into the dimension that would grow to become the Feywild and left behind a massive crater that some claim is a doorway to the lost realm. 

A land rooted in magic, Ophidians have incredible arcane power. Despite the small size of their nation, the state is responsible for much of the scientific and arcane advancement of the continent.
