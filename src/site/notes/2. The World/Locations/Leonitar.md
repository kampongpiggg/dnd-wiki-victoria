**Leonitar**, also known as **the Lion City** or the **Crowned Ruby of the South**, was the capital, and also largest city of the Five Realms. Located on the south of the continent Leucaria, it is the site of the Concordant Throne, the seat of power of [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]]. Coupled with it's strategic position overlooking the [[2. The World/Locations/Lion's Straits\|Lion's Straits]], a major maritime trade artery, Leonitar is one of the most important and influential cities in the world.

## Description
Often bathed in warm light and sea mist, Leonitar is a city of beautiful marble spires, copper domes and slender minarets rising in tiers. Famed for its grand and colorful architecture, the beautifully designed city enjoys a warm climate and is luxurious for those that can afford it. The River Tiber cuts through the heart of the city and empties into the Bay of Lions, in turn forming multiple quays where carnivals and festivals are often held.

## Government
Leonitar is home to the Concordant Throne, an office of government established by the signing of the Concord after [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]]. The Victorian Emperor rules the Empire from Leonitar, often holding council with his/her advisors.

Governance and general management of the city is deferred to the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]], a council of noble lords residing in the city. They oversee regional economy, maintained security, performed diplomacy and kept law and order through the City Watch. They hold ultimate legal authority in the city. Rulings on the city's laws were issued by the Chamber, who would run the courts and issue sentences, often harsh, on those found guilty.

## Culture
Given its size and influence, Leonitar was a cosmopolitan city with a diverse population of citizens. Leonitarians tended to be social, stalwart and outspoken people who were open-minded. While they often sought the improvement of their lives through the accumulation of wealth and self-importance, meritocracy is a central core value for them as a people as they believe the best and brightest, regardless of race, religion or socio-economic background, should be developed to their fullest potential. 

Education is free, and mandatory. Youths in the city must be registered to a guild or organization as an apprentice by the age of sixteen. Many, however, strive to join the illustrious [[2. The World/Organisations/Hexeverel\|Hexeverel]], the principal place of arcane study. A prestigious, rigourous and highly selective institute of higher learning, it draws many scholars from all over the realms and is at the forefront of scientific and arcane research.

Because of its ethnic and species diversity, festivals and celebrations were commonplace. These festivals and celebrations often served as opportunities for artists and artisans to display and showcase their work. As a result, Leonitar attracts many aspiring and talented individuals to come and contribute to its great culture.

Unfortunately, the city was not without its flaws. Because of its sheer size, the city requires a large population of working class folks to keep it going; many of these folks, mostly half-orcs, cannot afford to live in the posh districts, often living in cramped conditions in Uruk Alley.

## History

## Trade
A major trading hub due to its location overlooking the Lion's Straits, Leonitar served as an important rest and resupply point for both merchant caravans coming from the mainland seeking to distribute their wares across the oceans and naval ships looking to make port before continuing their journey. This also facilitated the development of industry within the city, as mineral-rich lands in the north would often send raw materials into the city for transformation.

Docking at the port in the Bay of Lions is free - taxation is not levied on the goods passing through the Straits. However, due to the need for regulating the flow of ships, heavy fines and punishment await those who violate the commands of the Flux Marshal.

## Defenses
Leonitar has several armed forces to keep the peace throughout the city. The City Watch was the local police force, serving as a constabulary within the city with powers of arrest over its citizens. They were commanded by the Sightwarden, typically appointed by the Chamber. 

However, being the seat of imperial power, the Emperor's royal guards - the [[2. The World/Organisations/The Victorian Revolutionary Guard\| Victorian Revolutionary Guard ]] - also operate in the city. They are less concerned with the day-to-day problems of the city, and more focused on protection of the city and the royal Emperor. As an elite unit of spellcasters and martials, they are also often deployed to different parts of the Empire to deal with extraordinary threats.

There were also a large amount of mercenary companies for hire within the city; Leonitar also benefited an unusually large native population of adventurers who were often more than willing to deal with any threats to their home cities.

The city is walled to the north to prevent a land assault, with arcane ballistae and cannons mounted upon its high brick walls. To its south, the Bay of Lions is defended by the Empire's Navy. Arcane traps, set in the bottom of the bay, can also be activated to repel a naval assault.
