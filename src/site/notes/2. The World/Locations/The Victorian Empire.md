**The Victorian Empire** was the political entity that controlled most of the continent of Leucaria, born from the Concord after [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]]. It is ruled by [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]] from the city of [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\|Leonitar]].



## Government
An incredibly diverse land, the Empire is made up of five smaller nation states. Each nation state not only has their own distinct environments, but is also in turn governed by their own political entity. The nations are:
1. [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]], a democratic republic governed by [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]];
2. [[2. The World/Locations/The Verdant Reach\|The Verdant Reach]], a tribal chiefdom united by [[2. The World/Organisations/Clan Ladon\|Clan Ladon]];
3. [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]], a magocracy led by the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]];
4. [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]], a merchant republic directed by [[2. The World/Organisations/The High Syndicacy\|The High Syndicacy]], and lastly,
5. [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]], subordinate to the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]].

Each entity oversaw regional economy, maintained security, performed diplomacy and kept law and order. They hold ultimate legal authority in their states, but all entities are under the authority of the Emperor.

## History
After the Sundering War led to the deaths of a third of life on the Leucaria continent, the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]] proposed the Concord: a peace treaty born from the formation of a continent-wide Empire. All the nations would combine to form a unified Empire, under the command of [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\| The Victorian Emperor]].

Firstly, power over the Empire would be rotated amongst the nations; control of the throne as the Emperor would be seen as a service and duty to lead the Empire, instead of a position for absolute control. This prompted new laws for succession - imperial power would not be isolated within specific bloodlines, but instead passed on by selection from the previous Emperor. Several legal restrictions were imposed on who could be selected to inherit the throne - candidates selected must be a current, sovereign ruler of one of the nations in the Empire, no child of an Emperor is eligible, and no citizen of the current Emperor's nation is eligible.

Second, each nation would levy 30% of their taxes and 50% of their armies to the Empire to not only bolster rebuilding the war-torn areas and recovery of the people but keep continental peace from lingering tensions and rising crime. This was also done to ensure no other nation would go to war with another again, as they would face the combined might of the other four states.

After the terms of the Concord was ratified, the nations united under the blue-and-yellow banner of the Empire. The Empire was subsequently named after its first Emperor, the hero of the Concord, [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\| General Victoria Parcival]]. With her leadership, the continent enjoyed 35 years of peace and prosperity.
