> **King Arthur Hamilton**: And what other life can we have? You want to leave the comfort of this castle, where your every need is catered to by servants? You want to be out there with the serfs and the commoners and the peasants, toiling in the fields? You want us to go out there and struggle?
> **Queen Gwendolyn Hamilton**: YES! I'd rather struggle in the mud and the dirt than to stay here and watch my baby be used as a *fucking* bargaining chip. I won't raise our child in this poison.

The **Kingdom of Alastia** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located in the south of the continent overlooking [[2. The World/Locations/Lion's Straits\|Lion's Straits]], the Kingdom of Alastia is the current leader of the Concord. It is the seat of the Concordant Throne and the home of the [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]]. They are administered by the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]], under the direct jurisdiction of the Emperor.

## Description
The powerful vassal houses under the King of Alastia meant that many of her towns and cities were uniquely designed. For instance, in the [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\| capital]], copper domes and gilded spires form the staple of architecture, but in Ryoko, these are traded in for red timber framed buildings with bilateral symmetry, curved roofs and enclosed courtyards.

## Government
Formerly, Alastia was ruled by the King of Alastia. The monarchy was abolished after [[2.

The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]], a council made up of the former vassal houses of the Hamiltons. 

Alastia also serves as *primus inter pares* of the Empire; its capital Leonitar is the home of the Concordant Throne and seat of the [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]]. Although the office of the Emperor passes between the nations, the seat of power remains in Leonitar.
