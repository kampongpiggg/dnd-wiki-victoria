> **King Arthur Hamilton**: And what other life can we have? You want to leave the comfort of this castle, where your every need is catered to by servants? You want to be out there with the serfs and the commoners and the peasants, toiling in the fields? You want us to go out there and struggle?
> **Queen Gwendolyn Hamilton**: YES! I'd rather struggle in the mud and the dirt than to stay here and watch my baby be used as a *fucking* bargaining chip. I won't raise our child in this poison.

The **Kingdom of Alastia** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located in the south of the continent overlooking [[2. The World/Locations/Lion's Straits\|Lion's Straits]], the Kingdom of Alastia is the current leader of the Concord. It is the seat of the Concordant Throne and the home of the [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]]. They are administered by the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]], under the direct jurisdiction of the Emperor.

## Description
The powerful vassal houses under the King of Alastia meant that many of her towns and cities were uniquely designed. For instance, in the [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\| capital]], copper domes and gilded spires form the staple of architecture, but in Ryoko, these are traded in for red timber framed buildings with bilateral symmetry, curved roofs and enclosed courtyards.

## Government
Formerly, Alastia was ruled by the King of Alastia. The monarchy was abolished after [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]] and the establishment of the Concord; affairs of the state are now the duties of the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]], a council made up of the former vassal houses of the Hamiltons. 

Imperial power is also tied intrinsically to the Kingdom. Alastia serves as the *primus inter pares* of the Empire; its capital Leonitar is the home of the Concordant Throne and seat of the [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]]. Although the office of the Emperor passes between the nations, the seat of power remains in Leonitar. 

## Culture
As the second most populous state in the Empire, and the nation with the largest land size, culture is extremely diverse in the Kingdom of Alastia. A melting pot of races and backgrounds, the Kingdom was generally welcome to all persuasions.

Meritocracy is a key value for the people of Alastia. They believe that the best and brightest should succeed regardless of race, religion or class status, an opinion shared by their [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|Rarquet]] neighbours. Where they differ would be their views on equality: the Alastian believes that all should be given the same opportunity to excel, while the Rarquesian would not think twice about exploiting unequal starting points.

## History
In 742 AY, King [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] married the commoner half-elf Gwendolyn Maegyr against the wishes of the Dowager Queen [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\|Eleanor Hamilton]]. Because of her low birth and elven heritage, this caused significant friction in the court, a result not only from the disapproval of the Dowager Queen but also the slight experienced by the vassal houses.

After the death of King Arthur Hamilton at the hands of the elven assassins [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\|Vaxildan & Vexalia]], the Dowager Queen [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\|Eleanor Hamilton]] seized power, displacing the rightful queen by the laws of succession [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]]. This led to international outrage from both [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]] and [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]]. In response, the Republic decided to launch an armed intervention, seeking to remove the Dowager Queen and replace the rightful queen Gwendolyn. This led to the outbreak of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]].

Initially, the rapid advance of the Republic Legion was stalled outside Ryoko by the successful deployment of the warforged automatons acquired from [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]]. However, this stalemate did not last long. The Imperator [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]] bypassed Ryoko and Coatlan, instead capturing [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]] in a [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| two-day siege]]. The fall of such a strategic location led to the starvation and surrender of Ryoko and Coatlan. By 751 AY, Cer'Dorei had occupied a third of Alastian territories.

To break Cer'Dorei's advantage, the Dowager Queen forced her vassal houses to expose themselves to various cosmic forces, gaining powerful sorcerous abilities. This turned the tide of battle momentarily, resulting in heavy losses of Cer'Dorei. 

In 754 AY, after the entry of Ophidia liberated Republic-occupied cities and the successful [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|Operation Chisel]] led to the surrender of Rarquet, the coalition force of Ophidia and Alastia began preparing for a final offensive into the Republic. The Dowager Queen mustered her forces, placing them under the command of [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\| General Victoria Parcival]], and began the march on Cer'Dorei. While the host win battles along the way, the Dowager Queen eventually took ill and passed halfway to the Republic. The war council crowns General Victoria Parcival as her replacement.

In 755 AY, the combined might of the Alastians, the Ophidians and Clan Ladon defeats the Imperator outside [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]]. Following Cer'Dorei's surrender, peace talks began shortly after in the city of Caliburn's Rock. To prevent a future war, a Concord was reached: the nations would form a combined [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\| Victorian Empire]] under [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\|The Victorian Emperor]]. Imperial power would be rotated amongst the nations, and laws of succession were crystallized to ensure smooth transition of power.
