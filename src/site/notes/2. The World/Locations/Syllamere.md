**Syllamere** was a large border town in [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]], most famous for its heritage as the site of defeat of the [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Imperator Julian Yaeldrin]] at the end of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| The Sundering War]]. 

## Description
Filled with sprawling villas, amphitheaters and symmetrical plazas, Syllamere's beauty was not uncommon in the Republic. Beautifully decorated marble colonnades adorned buildings, a graceful and elegant display of the signature staple in Cer'Dorei design.

The city had a massive aqueduct, constructed over massive plains to draw water from the mountains. It was beneath this aqueduct where the final battle of the Sundering War was fought, marking it one of the most important battle sites in the 8th Century.

## Government
The town is administered by House Alarion, a former elven diplomat. They remain in power to this day.

## History
By 754 AY, after the decisive [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\| Operation Chisel]] crippled the Rarquet war machine and killed [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\| the Chancellor Ovina Torunn]], the Cer'Dorei Republic's advantage was broken. While the Republic still held many territories, the combined might of the Alastians, Ophidians and Clan Ladon mustered for a counteroffensive. 

After massacring [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\| The Cervine Senate]] and leaving behind only [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]] and [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] as survivors, the Imperator pulled back his forces, rendezvousing with them at Syllamere. As part of their retreat, he ordered them to "set fire from Gormalay to the Evergreen Glade," razing as many settlements as they could. He also sent a missive intended for the [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\|Dowager Queen]] for a parlay, although unbeknownst to him she had already been murdered. The missive was received by [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\| General Victoria Parcival]], who treated with the Imperator.

On the morning of the battle, the two parties attempted to broker a peace. General Victoria Parcival, the sorcerer Occtis Tychonis, the Archmage Felicity and War Chief Hralvok met with the Imperator, Pompeia Ganamede and Skald Qreqerr but was unable to obtain terms.

Combat started at midday. While historians could not agree on what caused the fighting to break out, there was substantial evidence that the General Victoria Parcival was seen leading the charge herself, astride her white steed Tempest. The cavalry smashed into the Cer'Dorei Legion as the Alastian sorcerers and archers rained down powerful blows. 

Elsewhere on the battlefield, the Russett Pride and Clan Ladon began a furious, vicious battle. Ophidians, under the command of the Archmage Felicity, brought down devastating arcane firepower; in a bid to stop the attrition, the Skald Qreqerr threw a spear with shocking accuracy and pierced through the Archmage's chest, killing her almost instantaneously. 

The fighting lasted hours; as the sun began its descent, the outcome of the battle became abundantly clear. Refusing to heed the advice of Pompeia Ganamede and retreat, the Imperator and the General became locked in single combat. She eventually, with a swift strike, decapitated the Imperator.

## Aftermath
The battle was the decisive engagement of the six-year long war. Upon the Imperator's defeaat, Pompeia Ganamede called for a ceasefire and surrendered; the Republic Legion was immediately taken as prisoners-of-war. Peace talks began immediately that night, although terms would not be finalized until two weeks later, in [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\|Leonitar]].

The peace talks, now known as the Concord, saw the establishment of a new Empire with its capital in Leonitar. The sorcerers of Alastia, who moderated the Concord, were subsequently installed as the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]] to administer the new capital city.
