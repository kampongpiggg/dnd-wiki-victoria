> **Imperator Julian Yaeldrin**:Come now, Vicky. You really want to lead all these people to their deaths? I thought you were supposed to be the compassionate one. Withdraw, or you will all die here.
> **General Victoria Parcival**: No, Julian. You are the one who will die here. And I will be the last thing you see.
> **Imperator Julian Yaeldrin**: Very well, let us make famous that field out there. And this little town of Syllamere that will forever mark the place of your callow defeat.
