**Syllamere** was a large border town in [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]], most famous for its heritage as the site of defeat of the [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Imperator Julian Yaeldrin]] at the end of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| The Sundering War]]. 

## Description
Filled with sprawling villas, amphitheaters and symmetrical plazas, Syllamere's beauty was not uncommon in the Republic. Beautifully decorated marble colonnades adorned buildings, a graceful and elegant display of the signature staple in Cer'Dorei design.

The city had a massive aqueduct, constructed over massive plains to draw water from the mountains. It was beneath this aqueduct where the final battle of the Sundering War was fought, marking it one of the most important battle sites in the 8th Century.

## Government
The town is administered by House Alarion, a former elven diplomat. They remain in power to this day.

## History
By 754 AY, after the decisive [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\| Operation Chisel]] crippled the Rarquet war machine and killed [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\| the Chancellor Ovina Torunn]], the Cer'Dorei Republic's advantage was broken. While the Republic still held many territories, the combined might of the Alastians, Ophidians and Clan Ladon mustered for a counteroffensive. 

After massacring [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\| The Cervine Senate]] and leaving behind only [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]] and [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] as survivors, the Imperator pulled back his forces, rendezvousing with them at Syllamere. As part of their retreat, he ordered them to "set fire from Gormalay to the Evergreen Glade," razing as many settlements as they could. He also sent a missive intended for the [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\|Dowager Queen]] for a parlay, although unbeknownst to him she had already been murdered. The missive was received by [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\|Victoria Parcival]], who treated with the Imperator.

On the morning of the battle, the two parties attempted to broker a peace. General Victoria Parcival, the sorcerer Occtis Tychonis, the Archmage Felicity and War Chief Hralvok met with the Imperator, Pompeia Ganamede and Skald Qreqerr but was unable to obtain terms.

Combat started in midday;
