**The Rarquet Assembly** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the eastern seaboard, Rarquet is a state that specializes in mining and mass production. Such is their strength in mass production that the artificers of Rarquet are able to produce magical arms, armour, automatons and elixirs at a volume that can meet the majority of the demand of the nations in the Empire. They are ruled by [[2. The World/Organisations/The High Syndicacy\|The High Syndicacy]].

## Description
A key characteristic of the Assembly would be the dull, red glow of all its towns and cities; the soft glow of ember from all of the forges seem to go on at all times of the day as production continues continuously in the state. 

The Rarquet capital Dunhammer was built into a valley formed from the peaks of the mountains known as the Spine of the World. As such, a large part of the city is in tundra, rendering the land infertile. Fortunately, the Spine is mineral-rich; exports of metals used for metalworking provided a large portion of the state's income prior to the rise of the artificer guilds.

Journeying east towards the coast led to warmer weather. Notably, significant fishing activity in the Smith's Reef provide food for the nation.

## Government
The nation is governed by the council of eight guild leaders known as the High Syndicacy. While democratic in nature, power is not evenly distributed; guild leaders have votes commensurate with the earning power of their guild. A guild that has generated more income in the last season (defined as a quarter of a year, or three months) would have more votes.

There eight guilds compete with one another in sales of four main products: arms, armour, automatons and alchemical products.

## Culture
Rarquet culture is very much characterized by a fast-paced, competitive environment where social status is often defined by individual achievement and a constant drive for accumulation of wealth. The people of Rarquet have an eye for efficiency and a "winner-take-all" mentality, defining success as winning or outperforming others.

Many of the denizens in Rarquet enjoy brewing their own ale, a common hobby due to their prowess in alchemy. While ale is not a top export of Rarquet, it is still famed throughout the continent.

## History
In 749 AY, Chancellor Ovina Torunn sent the Syndicacy agents [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\| Vaxildan and Vexalia]] into [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]] to assassinate King [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] behind the High Syndicacy's back. This was to incite a conflict between the Cer'Dorei Republic and the Kingdom of Alastia, and thus increase the Tin Titans' automaton sales. 

After the outbreak of the [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| war]], Rarquet began supplying weapons to both sides; in highest demand were the warforged automatons for their durability and offensive power. As the profits of her guild increased, so did Chancellor Ovina Torunn's influence on the High Syndicacy. By 750 AY, she was the most powerful member of the council and became the defacto Rarquet head-of-state.

In 752 AY, Alastia discovered the concurrent sale of automatons to Cer'Dorei and refused to buy more, denouncing Rarquet for war profiteering. In response, Chancellor Ovina Torunn sent her agents once again into [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]], [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\| bombing the Kryn Ward]] to draw the neutral nation into the war. While the attack was successful, Vaxildan and Vexalia were both apprehended and interrogated. They eventually revealed their patron

After liberating Coatlan and Ryoko from Republic Forces, a covert military operation against the Assembly was planned. In 754 AY, a coalition force [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\| assaulted Dunhammer and other key forges]] to cripple the war effort. [[2. The World/Organisations/Force Grey\|Force Grey]] led the assault on the Citadel, where they killed Chancellor Ovina Torunn. With her death, Rarquet exited the war.

During the Concord, Chancellor Eitri Lancaster represented the nation for ratifying the details.

## Trade
The booming artificer guilds present in Rarquet drive the economy; the Assembly's top exports are magically enhanced arms, armour, automatons and alchemical products. Additionally, Dunhammer has several important mines of specialty metals such as cobalt, aluminium, copper and adamantium. 

Given the lack of fertile land in Rarquet, the Assembly imports a majority of their food.

## Transportation
Many of Rarquet's cities and towns were famed for its tight and narrow streets and high walls. 

Like most cities, public transportation was available throughout the city, although nobles and people of high import often travelled privately. The options included:

- Drays, which were two-floored collective carriages that held a large number of seats and travelled through preset trajectories across the main boulevards. Fares varied between 2 and 4 copper.
- Hire-coaches, which were two-wheeled, two-seat carriages that could be called and dispatched to specific locations. Hire-coach drivers often roamed the city streets in search for passengers, who could call a free coach with a shout. Fares are often agreed upon in advance, and rarely exceeded 1 gold.
- Carriages were luxury vehicles that could accommodate up to 8 passengers comfortably; prices varied, but usually these vehicles were hired for the whole day. Depending on the luxury level of the carriage, these vehicles could fetch anywhere from 10 to 100 gold.

## Defenses
The nation is primarily defended by the Sentries of Rarquet, a hybrid army of warforged automatons commanded by elvish wizards. Each city also has their own City Watch.

In general, the warforged in the Sentries of Rarquet belong to three categories, depending on their functions: they could serve as diplomatic envoys, powerful juggernauts, or stealthy skirmishers. A group of six generally report to a elvish wizard, who would command these troops.

From Dunhammer to Smith's Reef, each settlement is heavily walled. Signal braziers are also deployed all across the city of Dunhammer, ready to burn blue to warn of an attack.
