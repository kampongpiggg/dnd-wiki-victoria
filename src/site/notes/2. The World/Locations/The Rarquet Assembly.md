**The Rarquet Assembly** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the eastern seaboard, Rarquet is a state that specializes in mining and mass production. Such is their strength in mass production that the artificers of Rarquet are able to produce magical arms, armour, automatons and elixirs at a volume that can meet the majority of the demand of the nations in the Empire. They are ruled by [[2. The World/Organisations/The High Syndicacy\|The High Syndicacy]].

## Description
A key characteristic of the Assembly would be the dull, red glow of all its towns and cities; the soft glow of ember from all of the forges seem to go on at all times of the day as production continues continuously in the state. 

The Rarquet capital Dunhammer was built into a valley formed from the peaks of the mountains known as the Spine of the World. As such, a large part of the city is in tundra, rendering the land infertile. Fortunately, the Spine is mineral-rich; exports of metals used for metalworking provided a large portion of the state's income prior to the rise of the artificer guilds.

Journeying east towards the coast led to warmer weather. Notably, significant fishing activity in the Smith's Reef provide food for the nation.

## Government
The nation is ruled by the council of eight guild leaders known as the High Syndicacy. While democratic in nature, power is not evenly distributed; guild leaders have votes commensurate with the earning power of their guild. A guild that has generated more income in the last season (defined as a quarter of a year, or three months) would have more votes.

There eight guilds compete with one another in sales of four main products: arms, armour, automatons and alchemical products.
