**Dashund's Lea** is a major trading town on [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]]'s northern front. A critically strategic city, it served a central hub in which supplies and reinforcements were funneled through to Alastia's northern frontier during [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]]. After the birth of the unified Victorian Empire and the construction of Ulysses Pass, the town has lost its strategic use, but continued to facilitate the trading of luxuries such as wine, candle and silk.

## Description
The outer walls of Dashund's Lea were 15 feet high, made of thick basic stonework and masonry. The northern gates had a portcullis held aloft by large chains. Outside the walls were fields where crop workers harvest various vegetables and crops.

In the interior, the city was made primarily of gray stone, a testament to the city's age. While a city in the Kingdom, it was not uncommon to see dwarves and gnomes of Rarquet, given its proximity to the border of the two countries. A central market - called the Pentamarket - drives trade in the area. 

## Government
The town is governed primarily by House Timmon, a minor noble house appointed by the King of Alastia. After the war the house still remains in control, albeit answering to the Victorian Emperor instead of the now-defunct King of Alastia.

## Culture
Trade - primarily driven by the Rarquet Assembly and the local Alastians - has led to the proliferation of dwarven culture throughout the town. Aside from forges and smiths, a large amount of taverns exist within the town, dedicated mostly to the dwarven appetite: a third of the crops grown in Dashund's Lea are potatoes, carrots and turnips, and it is estimated that almost a quarter of the town's imports is dwarven ale.

## History
In 750 AY, in a bid to break the stalemate of the Sundering War, [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Imperator Julian Yaeldrin]] took a contingent of 300 men to lay siege to the city, intending to sack it and deny further supplies and reinforcements to the Alastian northern front. This led to [[../History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea \| Siege of Dashund's Lea]], a two-day military engagement that resulted in the fall of the town.

The fall of Dashund's Lea marked a critical point in the Sundering War as the Republic not only broke the year-long stalemate, but cemented an advantage that would put them ahead for much of the war.

## Notable Inhabitants
- Lord Augustus Timmon
- Lady Morgaine Timmon
