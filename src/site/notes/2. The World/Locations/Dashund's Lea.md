> **Khan the Younger**: In case you haven't noticed, *Imperator*, our ally has betrayed us. The Assembly sells the Kingdom the same arms and armour they sell us. The Legion's advance has halted. It is only a matter of time before the Alastians launch a counter-attack. 
> **Julian Yaeldrin**: And that's why you're *not* the Imperator, Khan. They may have stopped our advance, but there's a flaw in their defense. Do you see it?

**Dashund's Lea** is a major trading town on [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]]'s northern front. A critically strategic city, it served a central hub in which supplies and reinforcements were funneled through to Alastia's northern frontier during [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]]. After the birth of the unified Victorian Empire and the construction of Ulysses Pass, the town has lost its strategic use, but continued to facilitate the trading of luxuries such as wine, candle and silk.
