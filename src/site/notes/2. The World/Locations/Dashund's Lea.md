> **Khan the Younger**: In case you haven't noticed, *Imperator*, our ally has betrayed us. The Assembly sells the Kingdom the same arms and armour they sell us. The Legion's advance has halted. It is only a matter of time before the Alastians launch a counter-attack. 
> **Julian Yaeldrin**: And that's why you're *not* the Imperator, Khan. They may have stopped our advance, but there's a flaw in their defense. Do you see it?
