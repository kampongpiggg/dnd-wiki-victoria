**The Verdant Reach** is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the northeastern part of the Leucaria continent, they were unified after [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]] and are currently ruled by the [[2. The World/People/War Chief Hralvok\| War Chief Hralvok.]]

## Description
The Verdant Reach is a place of incredible diversity; dense, thick vegetation in the jungles of Russett contrast sharply against the burning heat of the Scorching Sands. The difference in biomes facilitated the growth and life of various types of beastfolks, giving rise to the rich racial diversity in the Reach.

In general, the Reach can be divided into two regions: the Scorching Sands is a vast desert of dunes, overbearing heat, and sandstorms. Travel through the desert is dangerous not only because of the extreme weather, but also the many hungry creatures that reside there. In the west, the Russett Jungle is a mineral-rich, thickly vegetated jungle of choking humidity, home to carnivorous plants and venomous creatures.

Wildlife roam freely in the Reach, and greatly differs in location. Camels, meerkates and snakes can be found commonly in the Sands, but the most dangerous is the Dunewinder - huge, monstrous sandworms that move about under the desert. In the Jungle, displacer beasts and owlbears hunt for prey.

To the north, the Reach is bordered by the Cer'Dorei Republic, and freezing winter wastelands known only as the Savage Frontier.

## Government
As a political entity, Clan Ladon serves as the rulers of the Reach, under the leadership of the War Chief Hralvok. Having absorbed many of the smaller clans during the Sundering War, Clan Ladon is also the largest tribe in the Reach.

However, true government is deferred to the various tribal leaders, who provide guidance and counsel to their followers. It is estimated that there are over 30 tribes within the Reach, making it an extremely fractured place.

## Culture
The Reach does not really have a national identity; individuals are more likely to define their loyalty to their family and clan. That said, Reachfolk are a proud and honorable people. While they are less organized than the other nations, they possess the warrior attitude and seek the glory of battle. Warfare between the tribes goes back centuries, so while some Reachfolk might feel kinship with other Reachfolk over outsiders, it is equally likely for a given Reachfolk to feel more animosity to a member of an enemy clan.

## History
After the successful experimentation of the Alastian vassal houses during the Sundering War, the Imperator sought to even the battlefield by sending out diplomatic envoys to recruit various tribes in the Verdant Reach into the war effort. 

While many tribes rejected the offer (most notably the dragonborns of [[2. The World/Organisations/Clan Ladon\|Clan Ladon]], some did not. Founded by the unification of the leonin, centaur and aarakocra tribes who accepted the Imperator's offer of conquest, the Russett Pride elected Qreqerr as their Skald and began conducting raids against Alastia.

Out of fear that they will be massacred after the Sundering War, Hralvok united the tribes in the Scorching Sands, bringing beastfolk of many different races into his dragonborn clan. They then allied themselves with Alastia, leading raiding parties into the Russett Jungle and Coatlan against the Pride and Republic forces.

After the defeat of the Skald Qreqqer in the battle outside [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]], the Pride was disbanded. During the establishment of the Concord, Clan Ladon was recognized as the ruling entity in the Verdant Reach, led by the War Chief.

## Trade
Of all of its goods, the Reach exports gems at the greatest volume. Large deposits of the gems needed for spellcasting can be found in the Russett Jungle, and their mining facilitates much of the economy in the Reach. 

## Transportation
In the Jungle, horses are often used for transport. Given the high trade volume, a road network was developed over time, facilitating even horse-drawn carriages. Canoes and boats can also be used to traverse the jungle through the rivers and tributaries. This is in stark contrast to the the Sands; camels and other beasts of burden are the primary method of transportation. Travelling without an appropriate steed is often a death sentence given the extreme weather.
