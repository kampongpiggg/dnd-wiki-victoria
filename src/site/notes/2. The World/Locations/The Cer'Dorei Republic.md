**The Cer'Dorei Republic**, also known as Cer'Dorei or the Republic, is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the north of the continent where the land is most fertile, Cer'Dorei serves as the granary of the continent and provides grain and livestock for much of the Empire. They are ruled by [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]].

It is the most populous nation in the Empire.

## Description
Marble colonnades decorate the vaulted entrances to azure blue pools of the public baths. Sprawling villas, beautiful amphitheaters and symmetrical plazas decorate all of the Republic's cities. These structures were not built for the moment; it is said that when the Cer'Dorei builds, their buildings stand for centuries. 

Life in Nike - the capital of the Republic - revolved around the famed seven hills where various monumental architectural wonders like the Parthenon and Colosseum were erected.

Its people are primarily dressed in togas and laurel wreaths, but are known to indulge in silk doublets and dresses from time to time. 

## Government
The three major elements of the Republic were the [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|Senate]], the Legion, and the provincial government. 

Each individual settlement was administered by local magistrates, who were responsible for keeping law and order and extracting revenue. Local independence incentivized compliance, as magistrates who were cooperative with the Imperial government often enjoyed reduced taxation.

Membership in the Senate was determined in a hybrid, and largely democratic, nature. Popular consensus appointed 80 seats of the 100 seat vacancy. High-ranking magistrates and a small number of aristocratic nobles were given reign to appoint another 20. Senate membership is for life to ensure continuity and longevity of vision for the governance of the Republic. However, given the long lifespan of elves, it is often that many Senate members stay in power for centuries.

The Legion was used to enforce the will of the Senate; rebelling communities and settlements were kept in line by the Legion, a brutal and efficient fighting force famed for their discipline. 

## Culture
Known for their practicality, diligence and sense of duty, the Cer'Dorei people take on hardship with a smile on their face. Their stoic approach to the difficulties of life has enabled them to flourish, turning a land beset by giants in the Savage Peaks to one of the most prosperous in the land.

Culture in the Republic was highly urbanised; almost half of its population lived in densely packed cities. This imbued a certain amount of hustle and bustle to her cities as citizens attended public baths, chariot races and even gladiatorial combat for entertainment. The other half lived in farmlands in Forum Tritici, an agricultural settlement responsible for providing much of the grain and livestock necessary in the Empire. Because of the sharp difference in livelihood, there is a significant disparity with many cityfolk considering the farmers to be beneath them.

Despite the class differences and social disparity, cityfolk and farmers alike are united in their love for the Republic. In some instances, this fervor can boil over from patriotism to nationalistic pride.

## History
Sometime before 749AY, Senator [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]] orchestrated a plot with Chancellor Ovina Torunn of the Rarquet Assembly to assassinate the King of Alastia [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]]. This was meant to incite a war between the Republic and [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]] so that Yaeldrin could not only convince the Senate to install him as the Imperator of Cer'Dorei, but also increase Cer'Dorei's territories and bring glory to the Republic.

After the assassins [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\|Vaxildan & Vexalia]] assassinated [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] and the Dowager Queen [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\|Eleanor Hamilton]] seized control of the throne, the First Triumvirate consisting of the Senators Julian Yaeldrin, [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] and [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\| Khan the Younger]] convinced the Senate to declare a national emergency, install Julian as the Imperator of Cer'Dorei and launch an armed intervention into Alastia. 

The initial stages of this armed intervention was successful; Imperator Julian Yaeldrin led the Legion, enhanced by an army of automatons from the Rarquet Assembly, in a swift and violent advance into Alastia. This advance inadvertently stalled at Ryoko, as Alastian forces began using automatons as well. In a decisive move, the Imperator bypassed Ryoko and Coatlan, instead deciding to [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| lay siege to Dashund's Lea]]. The siege and subsequent fall of [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]] allowed the Republic to starve out Coatlan and Ryoko, who eventually surrendered. By 750 AY, Cer'Dorei controlled a third of Alastia's territories.

As the war continued, Cer'Dorei's advantage in the war began to wane slowly. By 755 AY, Ophidia's entry into the war led to the liberation of Coatlan and Ryoko, and the successful [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|Operation Chisel]] led to the surrender of [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]]. As defeat seemed imminent for the Republic, the Senate began calling for the removal of Julian Yaeldrin as the Imperator. During the Vote of No Confidence, the Imperator and his loyalists attacked and massacred the Senate, leaving behind only Pompeia Ganamede and Khan the Younger. Julian Yaeldrin then mustered his forces at [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]], treating with the oncoming coalition force led by [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\|General Victoria Parcival]].

The Cer'Dorei Legion was defeated at the battle of Syllamere. As the last surviving member of the Senate, Khan the Younger surrendered on behalf of the Republic and represented their interests in the negotiation of the Concord.

## Trade
As the most fertile land in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]], the Republic grow the lion's share of the grains, fruit and livestock that feed the Empire. Blessed with vast, blooming fields of crops, flowers and animals, its citizens toil endlessly to feed not only themselves but the less fertile parts of the Empire. Its core exports are grain, fruit, wine and livestock.

While it does not see as much maritime traffic as Lion's Marina, Nike's harbour is indubitably the second busiest port in the world. Notably, Nike' harbour serves as a much needed rest point for ships going to and coming from the Blasted Waste and the Shattered Teeth, and serves as an ingress for trade flowing north to south. 

## Transportation
Like most cities, public transportation was available throughout the city, although nobles and people of high import often travelled privately. Public transportation options included drays, hire-coaches and carriages.

In Nike, the River Tigris cuts across the city; as such, water transportation like gondolas were also available for hire.

The cities are interconnected via stone-paved roads; the oldest of which is called the Appian Way.

## Defenses
While a majority of the cities in the Republic were not walled, those that were had living walls. Rather than stacking bricks, Republic builders used Ether and fae magic to feed the earth, coaxing a continuous ridge of white marble from the ground. The walls, if breached, released a sap in a pressurized spray that could temporarily paralyzed attackers. If given enough time, the walls were also capable of self-repair.

Serving complementary to the Legion was the Nikean Cavalry, warriors mounted on massive elks and stags that would that provided support, scouting and flanking to the heavy infantry. In combat formations, they would serve as flank guards or pursuit forces.
