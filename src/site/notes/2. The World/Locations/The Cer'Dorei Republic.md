**The Cer'Dorei Republic**, also known as Cer'Dorei or the Republic, is a nation in [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\|The Victorian Empire]]. Located on the north of the continent where the land is most fertile, Cer'Dorei serves as the granary of the continent and provides grain and livestock for much of the Empire. They are ruled by [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]].

## Description
Marble colonnades decorate the vaulted entrances to azure blue pools of the public baths. Sprawling villas, beautiful amphitheaters and symmetrical plazas decorate all of the Republic's cities. These structures were not built for the moment; it is said that when the Cer'Dorei builds, their buildings stand for centuries. 

Life in Nike - the capital of the Republic - revolved around the famed seven hills where various monumental architectural wonders like the Parthenon and Colosseum were erected.

Its people are primarily dressed in togas and laurel wreaths, but are known to indulge in silk doublets and dresses from time to time. 

## Government
The three major elements of the Republic were the [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|Senate]], the Legion, and the provincial government.
