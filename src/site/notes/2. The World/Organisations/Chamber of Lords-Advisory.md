**The Chamber of Lords-Advisory** is the administrative council that runs the city of Leonitar. Formerly human vassal houses of the Hamiltons, they gained incredible sorcerous powers during [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]] in a dangerous gamble to defeat the [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]]. Following the war and the establishment of the Concord, they serve chiefly as diplomats and envoys, but also hold key positions in the institutions that drive the city and the Empire.

## History
The Chamber of Lords-Advisory is made up of the six noble and highly magical families who were former vassal houses of the Hamiltons. Prior to the Sundering War, these nobles ruled the six major towns within the Kingdom. 

After the loss of [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]] in [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| the Siege of Dashund's Lea]], the survivors of House Tychonis, the former rulers of the town, fled back to the capital. In a bid to break to gain the Republic's upper hand and as punishment for having lost the city, the [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\| Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton]] forcefully exposed the young heir of the house - Ymir Tychonis - to the Shadowfell, a dimension formed following the imprisonment of the Ksha'aravi, the Primordial of Shadow by the gods. The exposure supercharged her, imbuing her soul with powerful dark magic and turning her into the first sorcerer. The success of the experimentation pushed other vassal houses to join the experimentation, granting them various sorcerous abilities.

With the establishment of the Concord, their skill in diplomacy earned them key positions in institutions throughout the Empire.
