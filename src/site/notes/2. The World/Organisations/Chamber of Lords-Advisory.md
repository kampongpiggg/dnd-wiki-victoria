**The Chamber of Lords-Advisory** is the administrative council that runs the city of Leonitar and the nation of Alastia. Formerly human vassal houses of the Hamiltons, they gained incredible sorcerous powers during [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]] in a dangerous gamble to defeat the [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]]. Following the war and the establishment of the Concord, they serve chiefly as diplomats and envoys, but also hold key positions in the institutions that drive the city and the Empire.

## History
The Chamber of Lords-Advisory is made up of the six noble and highly magical families who were former vassal houses of the Hamiltons. Prior to the Sundering War, these nobles ruled the six major towns within the Kingdom. 

After the loss of [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]] in [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| the Siege of Dashund's Lea]], the survivors of House Tychonis, the former rulers of the town, fled back to the capital. In a bid to break the Republic's upper hand and as punishment for having lost the city, the [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\| Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton]] forcefully exposed the young heir of the house - Ymir Tychonis - to the Shadowfell, a dimension formed following the imprisonment of the Ksha'aravi, the Primordial of Shadow by the gods. The exposure supercharged her, imbuing her soul with powerful dark magic and turning her into the first sorcerer. The success of the experimentation pushed other vassal houses to join the experimentation, granting them various sorcerous abilities.

With the establishment of the Concord, their skill in diplomacy earned them key positions in institutions throughout the Empire.

## The Houses
These are the houses that serve in the Chamber of the Lords-Advisory:

###### House Tychonis
The first sorcerers, the House of Tychonis is a house of shadow. Existing in a twilight state between life and death, they draw their power from their connection with the dead and undead after Ymir was exposed to the Shadowfell. Their favored colors are black and gold.

###### House Luxjaro
The House of Luxjaro was the oldest and most powerful of the vassal houses. Originally the house in charge of administering the capital city of Alastia, the matriarch volunteered her scions for experimentation after the success of Ymir Tychonis. While it is unknown how they got their powers, it is suspected that their bloodline was mixed with divine ancestry of some kind. They have since established a new religion and serve as priests to proselytize.

###### House Eisensturm
Seeking to join the race for power, the House of Eisensturm propositioned the giants. Infused with the power of the storm giants, the House of Eisensturm wield the magic of the storm. They exert control over wind and weather, and are much more martial compared to the other houses in modern times.

###### House Tokugane
Having been besieged within Ryoko for much of the war, House Tokugane did not gain sorcerous powers until after the battle of Syllamere. One night after the formation of the Concord, just before the House was to move to Leonitar, the future heiresses of the House was reported to have snuck out into the woods for a late night party. It was then when they encountered a dying Modron, who connected them to the hive mind and granted the family their powers over chaos.

###### House Xicoatl
It is an open secret how House Xicoatl gained their power: they ate a dragon. An act of sacrilege quietly approved by War Chief Hralvok during the Sundering War, their forebearers ritually slain a dragon and ingested its blood and spine. While they no longer need to feast on dragons, it is unknown how the bloodline maintains its magic as it is common for descendants to emerge without sorcerous power. 

###### House Antarra
It is unknown how the House Antarra gained their psionic powers, but most scholars acknowledge a certain alien influence to their bloodline.
