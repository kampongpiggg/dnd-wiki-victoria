**The Chamber of Lords-Advisory** is the administrative council that runs the city of Leonitar. Formerly human vassal houses of the Hamiltons, they gained incredible sorcerous powers during [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]] in a dangerous gamble to defeat the [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]]. Following the war and the establishment of the Concord, they serve chiefly as diplomats and envoys, but also hold key positions in the institutions that drive the city and the Empire.
