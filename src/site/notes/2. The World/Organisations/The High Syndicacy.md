**The High Syndicacy** were the eight guild leaders who govern [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]]. They hold court in the High Hall of the Citadel.

## History

During the Alastian succession crisis, the High Syndicacy maintained neutrality, citing non-intervention in foreign nations. Unbeknownst to the other Chancellors, [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\|Ovina Torunn]] was responsible for sending elven assassins [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\|Vaxildan & Vexalia]] to assassinate [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] and engineer the crisis.

As [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]] broke out, the guilds of the High Syndicacy began selling arms, armour and automatons, mostly to Alastia. However, on top of that, Chancellor Ovina Torunn had already secured deals with the Republic beforehand, and was thus able to gain an overwhelming market share. As the only guild selling to both sides of the war, the Tin Titans' profits skyrocketed, allowing the Chancellor to gain a majority of the votes. With a dominant amount of power, she became the defacto Rarquet head-of-state.

In 752 AY, Alastia discovered the sale of automatons to Cer'Dorei and denounced Rarquet for profiting off the war. The Dowager Queen refused to buy automatons, a devastating economic blow to the Assembly. In an attempt to draw [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]] into the war to drive sales, Ovina sent her agents Vaxildan and Vexalia into Ophidia, [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\| bombing the Kryn Ward with a powerful arcane device]].

While the attack on the Kryn Ward was successful, Vaxildan and Vexalia were apprehended and interrogated. They revealed that their patron - the Chancellor Ovina Torunn - was responsible for the attack, putting a target on Rarquet.

Ophidia entered the war after the attack, liberating Coatlan and Ryoko from Republic forces. In addition, in 754 AY, a coalition force [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\| conducted a simultaneous assault on critical forges and smiths used to supply the war effort]]. As part of this effort, [[2. The World/Organisations/Force Grey\|Force Grey]] assaulted the High Syndicacy's stronghold - the Citadel of Dunhammer - in a bid to capture and kill Ovina Torunn. They succeeded; in response, the High Syndicacy withdrew from the war.

## The Guilds
Eight guilds make up the High Syndicacy. While they operate as a council, power is not evenly distributed. Instead, matters of deliberation are voted on by the guild leaders, who are responsible for the manufacturing and production of a type of magical item. Votes are commensurate with income; a guild leader gains more votes if their guilds generates greater income. 

To facilitate innovation and efficiency, guilds are forced to compete with another in sales.
