**Clan Ladon** was a nomadic clan in the Scorching Sands. Initially a clan of dragonborn, they expanded themselves in response to the formation of [[2.

They are the current ruling power in [[2. The World/Locations/The Verdant Reach\| the Reach]]

## History
After the successful experimentation of the Alastian vassal houses, the Imperator sought to even the battlefield by sending out diplomatic envoys to recruit various tribes in the Verdant Reach into the war effort. Initially reluctant to join the war, the Clan rejected the offer.

However, in response to the unification of the leonin, centaur and aarakocra tribes as the founding of the Pride, the Clan became worried that continued inaction may have disastrous consequences. Seeking to ensure their survival after the Sundering War, the [[2. The World/People/War Chief Hralvok\| War Chief Hralvok]] united the tribes in the Scorching Sands, integrating many other beastfolk into his dragonborn clan. They then committed to joining [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\| Alastia]]. 

After the defeat of the Skald Qreqqer in the battle outside Syllamere, the Pride was disbanded. During the establishment of the Concord, Clan Ladon was recognized as the ruling entity in the Verdant Reach.
