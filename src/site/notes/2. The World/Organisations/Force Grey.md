**Force Grey** was an elite military unit in service of the nation of Ophidia. Their primary responsibility was to deal with threats that the Ophidian military could not handle without risking significant loss of life.

## Organisation and Activities
A band of powerful and highly skilled adventurers, Force Grey was expected to deal with the toughest enemies and threats to Ophidia. Would-be members were required to demonstrate exceptional prowess in battle or command of powerful spells. The unit enjoyed a regular rotation of members, particularly due to the incredible high risk of death.

Directly answerable to the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]], Force Grey was expected to enforce law and order. However, members were not expected to patrol the city for threats nor stand guard; they served as an emergency response force and act as an elite strike force for threats that demanded a more extreme or specialized approach.

While not on missions, each member was free to follow their own goals, so long as they were readily available when called to action. 

## Tactics
Generally called on for special operations, their primary use during the Sundering War saw them infiltrating behind enemy lines for reconnaissance and raids.
