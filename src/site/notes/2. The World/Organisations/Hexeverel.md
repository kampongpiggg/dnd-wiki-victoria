The **Hexeverel** is a prestigious institution of higher learning in [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\|Leonitar]]. An academy dedicated for the study of science and the arcane arts, they offer boarding school programmes for wizards, artificers, natural philosophers and engineers. It is considered one of the most premier schools in the world.

## Description
Located at the center of the Madrasa District, Hexeverel buildings are connected with one another by many small, colored, covered skybridges. Their facades are incredibly colorful, made from red sandstone, alabaster, pink quarts and purple amethysts. Almost half of the buildings are wizard towers.

The Hexeverel also has a Great Hall, where many important lectures have been given.

## History
Founded by six great wizards, the Hexeverel drove the rapid development of science and the arcane arts. Many breakthroughs happened on campus grounds, most notably the invention of printing and the illusory script and the art of dunamancy.

Following the unification of the continent after the Sundering War, it is common that a member of the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\|Ring of Gold]] would serve as Dean.
