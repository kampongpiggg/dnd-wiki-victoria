The **Victorian Revolutionary Guard** are the royal guards of the [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\| Emperor]]. They are charged with a dual mandate - the protection of the Concord, above all else, and the protection of the Emperor. Their armor, often customized to the individual knight, is stylized in white and gold. As an elite unit of spellcasting martials, they are also often deployed to different parts of the Empire to deal with extraordinary threats.

## History
Founded after [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]], the Revolutionary Guard was founded to protect the delicate peace brought about by the Concord. They also have a secondary mandate to serve as the Emperor's guards. As of 790 AY, there are about 150 knights in their service.

Although they are headquartered in [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\|Leonitar]], they are generally unconcerned with the daily problems of the city, preferring to leave such matters to the jurisdiction of the City Watch. 

## Organizational Structure
In peacetime, the Revolutionary Guard is charged with the protection of the Concord and the Emperor; on a daily basis, this entails training recruits, commanding and staffing Imperial garrisons throughout the continent, investigating potential threats to the Concord and the protection of the Emperor.

In war, the Guard is expected to command the levied Imperial forces against rebelling nation states. They also to coordinate between participating national forces.

To facilitate this, the Lord Commander - usually a sitting member of the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]] - oversees the many garrisons and branches of the Imperial Army. The Army is made up of three branches:
- Recruiting and Training.
- Garrison Defense
- Intelligence
