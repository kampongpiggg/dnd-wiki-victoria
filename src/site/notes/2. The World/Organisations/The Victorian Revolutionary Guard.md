However, being the seat of imperial power, the Emperor's royal guards - the [Victorian Revolutionary Guard](app://obsidian.md/Organisations/The%20Victorian%20Revolutionary%20Guard) - also operate in the city.

As an elite unit of spellcasters and martials, they are also often deployed to different parts of the Empire to deal with extraordinary threats.
