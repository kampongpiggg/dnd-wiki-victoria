The **Ring of Gold**, also known as the Archmages of the Octarion, were the eight archmages and current governing power of the nation of [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]]. 

## History
During the outbreak of the [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]], the Ring of Gold condoned both the coup instituted by the Dowager Queen and the invasion by the Republic, but ultimately decided to maintain neutrality.

After the [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\|Attack on the Kryn Ward]] which saw the death of the Archmage Maribel, the Ring of Gold promoted her protege and mentee [[2. The World/People/Felicity\|High Mage Felicity]] into her position. Even though they were attacked directly by [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\| the Assembly]], many still voiced concern about joining the war. Assuming her mentor's station, the Archmage Felicity casted the tiebreaking vote for Ophidia's entry into the war.

The entry of Ophidia into the Sundering War facilitated in the liberation of Ryoko and Coatlan as Republic and Assembly forces were pushed out from the cities they were occupying. In spite of this massive victory, Alastia and Ophidia had insufficient forces for a counteroffensive. In response, the Ring of Gold approved for [[2. The World/Organisations/Force Grey\|Force Grey]] to scout behind enemy lines and identify high-value sites for a simultaneous assault to criple Rarquet and Cer'Dorei.

After the successful execution of [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|Operation Chisel]], the Ring of Gold sent Force Grey to lead their army in the march towards Cer'Dorei as they set their sights on [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\| a final counteroffensive]].
