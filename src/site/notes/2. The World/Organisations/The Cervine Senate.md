The **Cervine Senate** was the democratic council that govern [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]]. Made up of 100 life-term aristocratic and plebeian members, they directed foreign policy, managed the treasury and issued binding decrees to magistrates who enforce the law. They hold court in Nike, the capital of the Cer'Dorei Republic. 

## History
During the Alastian succession crisis, the Cervine Senate publicly condemned the actions of the Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton. Many were outraged not only at the violation of the laws of succession, but also at the racial element of the coup. Despite this, many members were reluctant to intervene, as the Legion was still having difficulty combating the giantkind in the Savage Peaks. 

Wanting to go to war, Senators [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]], [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\| Pompeia Ganamede]] and [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\| Khan the Younger]] began exerting their influence. Through a web of blackmail and underhanded favors, the First Triumvirate swung the votes, convincing the nation to go to [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| war]]. A national emergency was declared, with Julian installed as the Imperator.

During the War, the Imperator delegated the duties of administration to Khan the Younger, who kept the nation running. In 750 AY, he learnt that the Chancellor Ovina Torunn of  [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]] was selling automatons to both Cer'Dorei and Alastia. The Senate confronted the Imperator, who deflected the question and revealed his plans to [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| lay siege to Dashund's Lea]]. The successful siege and subsequent fall of Dashund's Lea allowed Cer'Dorei to seize a significant portion of Alastian territories, a decisive victory for the Republic.

By 755 AY, Ophidia's entry into the war liberated occupied Alastian territories and the successful execution of [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|Operation Chisel]] saw the exit of [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\| Rarquet]] from the war. As defeat seemed imminent for Cer'Dorei, the Senate began calling for the removal of Julian Yaeldrin so that they could sue for peace. During the Vote of No Confidence, the Imperator attacked the Senate with his loyalists. The resultant bloodbath saw the slaughter of all Senators, leaving behind only Pompeia Ganamede and Khan the Younger. The Imperator then mustered his forces, and marched to [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]] where he was subsequently defeated.

After his death, Khan the Younger surrendered and began rebuilding the Senate. He also represented Cer'Dorei in the Concord.

## Membership and Appointment
Members of the Senate were appointed in a hybrid, largely democractic fashion. Popular consensus appointed 80 seats, while high-ranking magistrates and aristocratic nobles appointed the other 20. Senate membership is for life, ensuring continuity and longevity of vision for the governance of the Republic.

Debates were held in order of seniority. After all members have had an opportunity to speak, a vote would be called, often done via voice or a show of hands.
