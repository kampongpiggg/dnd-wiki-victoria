**Julian Yaeldrin**, also known as the Imperator of [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\| the Cer'Dorei Republic]], was a former war hero and subsequently Senator of the [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]]. A member of the First Triumvirate with [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]] and [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]], Julian Yaeldrin held significant political sway. As part of his scheme to become Imperator, he incited the Alastian succession crisis, which eventually escalated to become [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]].

## Early Life and Rise to Power
Julian Yaeldrin was born poor, and more importantly hungry. His parents were a pair of farmers in an unnamed village which was frequently attacked by giants. When he turned twelve, the Legion came to the village, seeking recruits. Many of the children in the village, including both Julian and his sister Azula, participated, competing in an obstacle course. When only Azula was selected, she convinced the Legion officers to recruit him too. Whilst the Legionnaires were unimpressed with his potential, they accept him nonetheless.

Their enlistment gave the siblings a chance for food and survival; in tears, Julian said goodbye to his parents, noticing that they were a lot more gaunt compared to the other parents and realizing that they had been giving the both of them more food. 

In the Legion, the pair battled giantkind in the Savage Peaks. During this time, Julian  and Azula Yaeldrin began to earn marks of prestige, rising up the ranks. While both siblings were extremely proficient at felling giants, Azula was unfortunately caught in an avalanche during a ranging expedition. 

It is unknown when he met [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]], but most historians believe that Julian began his rise to power first assigned as a man-at-arms in service of [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]]. Some believed that [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] and him became lovers, but none could deny their effectiveness. Together, the trio not only struck up a close friendship, but began to exert substantial influence in Nike, eventually becoming Senators.
