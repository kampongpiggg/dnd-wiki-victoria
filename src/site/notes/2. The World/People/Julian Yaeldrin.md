**Julian Yaeldrin**, also known as the Imperator of [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\| the Cer'Dorei Republic]], was a former war hero and subsequently Senator of the [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]]. A member of the First Triumvirate with [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]] and [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]], Julian Yaeldrin held significant political sway. As part of his scheme to become Imperator, he incited the Alastian succession crisis, which eventually escalated to become [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]].

## Early Life and Rise to Power
Julian Yaeldrin was born poor, and more importantly hungry. His parents were a pair of farmers in an unnamed village which was frequently attacked by giants. When he turned twelve, the Legion came to the village, seeking recruits. Many of the children in the village, including both Julian and his sister Azula, participated, competing in an obstacle course. When only Azula was selected, she convinced the Legion officers to recruit him too. Whilst the Legionnaires were unimpressed with his potential, they accept him nonetheless.

Their enlistment gave the siblings a chance for food and survival; in tears, Julian said goodbye to his parents, noticing that they were a lot more gaunt compared to the other parents and realizing that they had been giving the both of them more food. 

In the Legion, the pair battled giantkind in the Savage Peaks. During this time, Julian  and Azula Yaeldrin began to earn marks of prestige, rising up the ranks. While both siblings were extremely proficient at felling giants, Azula was unfortunately caught in an avalanche during a ranging expedition. 

It is unknown when he met [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]], but most historians believe that Julian began his rise to power first assigned as a man-at-arms in service of [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]]. Some believed that [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] and him became lovers, but none could deny their effectiveness. Together, the trio not only struck up a close friendship, but began to exert substantial influence in Nike, eventually becoming Senators.

## The Sundering War 
### Crisis in Alastia 
Sometime before 749 AY, Julian Yaeldrin met [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\|Ovina Torunn]]. Together, they hatched a plot to incite a war between [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\|The Kingdom of Alastia]] and [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]]. Julian sought to use this opportunity to engineer a national emergency and be installed as Imperator, subsequently proving his efficacy through conquest. On the other hand, Ovina Torunn sought to increase the sale of automatons under her guild the Tin Titans, thereby increasing her number of votes in the High Syndicacy. 

The pair instructed the elven assassins [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\|Vaxildan & Vexalia]] to assassinate [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]], the King of Alastia. The assassins succeeded; by the laws of succession, the throne was to pass to his wife, the half-elf [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]]. As Julian had predicted, the [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\| Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton]] used this opportunity to seize the throne, citing her daughter-in-law's elven heritage as an excuse that she was unfit to rule, seeing that the assassins were elven. 

The violation of the laws of succession, particularly that of a half-elf, was condemned by both [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]] and the Republic. In addition, Julian, Pompeia and Khan the Younger began advocating for a national emergency and foreign intervention. They succeeded, and Julian is installed as the Imperator.

### The Siege of Dashund's Lea 
Leading the Legion in a brutal and rapid advance, the war effort went particularly well initially. However, because of the concurrent sale of arms, armour, and more importantly automatons by the Rarquet Assembly to Alastia, the advance into Alastia stalled. This stalemate went on for months with heavy attrition on both sides. Pressure began to mount in the Senate, as more people began to fear a counter-attack.

To circumvent this, Julian decided to lead a small force of 300 men to lay [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| lay siege to Dashund's Lea]]. The [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\| town]] was a critical chokepoint where supplies flowed from the Alastian heartland to the frontlines. It was believed that the capture of this city would starve out Coatlan and Ryoko. As this decisive act demanded that the troops bypass multiple, larger cities along the way, the Imperator decided to close in with a small force for speed and stealth. He reportedly left  behind cannons and automatons, favoring the small contingent armed with force ballistae. 

The siege was short and brutal. For two days wave after wave of bolts rained down upon the city walls. Any attempt to send word out for aid was stopped: carrier pigeons were shot out of the sky, messengers were caught and slaughtered publicly before the walls. After two days, the city walls gave way. Soldiers reported that the Imperated, with a deafening roar, charged into the city, sacking it violently. Almost all of the defenders of the City were executed. By the time the Alastians knew Dashund's Lea had fallen, the majority of the Republic military had already caught up, fortifying themselves within the city.

The fall of Dashund's Lea marked a critical point in the Sundering War with Cer'Dorei breaking the year-long stalemate and cementing an advantage that would put them ahead for much of the war.

### Diplomacy in the Reach
The loss of Dashund's Lea dealt a significant blow to Alastia. In response, the Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton forced her vassal houses to experiment with various cosmic forces. While many died, these houses eventually gained powerful sorcerous abilities. These sorcerers began unleashing their power in the battlefield, wrecking havoc and causing significant casualties in the Legion.

In a bid to bolster their numbers, the Imperator sent out several envoys, led by [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] to treat with the warlords of [[2. The World/Locations/The Verdant Reach\| the Verdant Reach]]. While many rejected the offer, three clans - the leonin, centaur and aarakocra - agreed to join the effort on the promise that the Republic would help them take control of the Reach after the war. These clans united to become [[2. The World/Organisations/The Russett Pride\|The Russett Pride]], and began raiding Alastia.

### Massacre in the Senate
By 755 AY, Cer'Dorei was losing. Ophidia had entered the war and liberated the occupied Alastian territories; the Rarquet Assembly had surrendered following the death of the Chancellor Ovina Torunn.  Notably, the Senate began calling for the removal of Julian to sue for peace.

Furious, the Imperator gathered his loyalists and assaulted the Senate during the Vote of No Confidence. The resultant massacre saw the deaths of all Senators, with only Pompeia Ganamede and Khan the Younger surviving. He then mustered his forces at [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]], planning to meet the oncoming coalition army headon.
