Senator Khan Seneca, better known as **Khan the Younger**, served in the [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\|The Cervine Senate]], where he participated in an informal alliance with [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]] and [[2. The World/People/Pompeia Ganamede\|Pompeia Ganamede]] known as the First Triumvirate. Together, they dominated politics and wielded substantial influence in the governance of the Republic, even to the point of swaying the Senate to declare a national emergency and approve foreign intervention during the Alastian succession crisis. This led to the outbreak of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]].

During the war, Khan the Younger served in place of the Imperator on the Senate, managing daily governance of the Republic as Yaeldrin led the armies to war. In 750 AY, Khan the Younger learned that Chancellor [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\|Ovina Torunn]] had been selling automatons to both [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\| Cer'Dorei]] and [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\| Alastia]]. He then led the Senate to confront the [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Imperator Julian Yaeldrin]], who deflected his question by revealing his plans to [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| lay siege to Dashund's Lea]]. The successful siege and subsequent fall of Dashund's Lea allowed Cer'Dorei to seize a third of Alastia's territories, a decisive victory for the Republic. 

In 754 AY, after the death of Chancellor Ovina Torunn and the exit of the Rarquet Assembly from the Sundering War, civic pressure for surrender began mounting in Nike. In his fury, the Imperator Julian Yaeldrin slaughtered the Senate for voicing their dissent, but left Khan the Younger and Pompeia Ganamede alive. 

After the battle of [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]], Khan the Younger surrendered on behalf of the Cer'Dorei and participated in the talks to establish the Concord, representing the interests of the Republic.
