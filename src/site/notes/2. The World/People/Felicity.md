Formerly a protege of Maribel Merewyn, an Archmage of the Ring of Gold, **Felicity** was a bright and young woman. When [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\| Chancellor Ovina Torunn]] directed [[2. The World/People/Velissa & Vexalia\| Syndicacy agents]] to [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\| attack the Kryn Ward]] and thus pull [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]] into [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]], she inadvertently kills Maribel Merewyn.

Driven by vengeance, she succeeds Maribel as an Archmage. In 754 AY, she succeeds in her quest, leading Force Grey in [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\| an assault that kills Chancellor Ovina Torunn]].

She was ultimately killed in the battle outside [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\| Syllamere]] by Skald Qreqerr.
