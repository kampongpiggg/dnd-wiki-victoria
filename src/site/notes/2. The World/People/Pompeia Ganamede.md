Senator **Pompeia Ganamede** served in [[2. The World/Organisations/The Cervine Senate\| The Cervine Senate]]. She was part of an informal alliance with [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]] and [[2. The World/People/Khan the Younger\|Khan the Younger]], known as the First Triumvirate. This alliance wielded substantial influence in the governing body of [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]], allowing the three of them to dominate politics. During the Alastian succession crisis, the First Triumvitate swayed the Senate to declare a national emergency, install Julian Yaeldrin as the new Imperator of Cer'Dorei and approve foreign intervention to install [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]] as the rightful Queen. This led to the outbreak of [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]].

During the war, Pompeia served as the Imperator's right hand woman. She was often required to lead supporting military efforts, and was often where he was not. Other than her feats in battle, she was a skilled negotiator, overseeing the diplomatic effort in [[2. The World/Locations/The Verdant Reach\| the Verdant Reach]]. Her success saw [[2. The World/Organisations/The Russett Pride\|The Russett Pride]] joining the Republic war effort.

After the massacre at the Senate, she rode south with the Imperator, mustering with the forces at [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]]. She was present at the parlay before the battle, which unfortunately could not achieve terms. 

During the battle, she led a phalanx of Legion, which was broken by Alastian cavalry. As the outcome of the battle became clear, it was reported she ran to the Imperator's side, urging him to retreat. This advice sadly fell on deaf ears as the Imperator charged [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\| General Victoria Parcival]], engaging in the duel that will end his life.

Her whereabouts is currently unknown.
