**Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton** was the dowager queen of [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\| Alastia]] and the mother of the late [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]], who was assassinated by elven assassins at the behest of [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Senator Julian Yaeldrin]] and [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\| Chancellor Ovina Torunn]]. Her decision to seize the throne from her daughter-in-law [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]] was a catalytic event that led to [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]], a major multi-theater international conflict across the continent.

## Tension in the Court
After the ascension of [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] to the throne in 740 AY, the Dowager Queen began the search for a suitable queen consort for her son. While many of her [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\| vassal houses]] presented their daughters as possible suitors, Arthur went against the advice of his council and married a common half-elf he had met during his travels. This was a widely contentious move, not only because of the social class of Gwendolyn Maegyr, but also the growing resentment at elves who often saw themselves as a superior species. 

Against the wishes of the Dowager Queen, King Arthur insisted on his marriage to Gwendolyn, making her Queen Consort. This upset both the Dowager Queen and the vassal houses, leading to an undercurrent of tension in the court. Dowager Queen would often snipe at the Queen Gwendolyn with condescending remarks about her birth and class status.

## The Sundering War
In 749 AY, after the death of [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] at the hands of [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\|Vaxildan & Vexalia]], despite not being next in the line of succession, the Dowager Queen denied the throne to the rightful [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]] and seized power. 

This prompted [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]].

During the War, seeking to gain an edge over her enemies, she pushed her vassal houses - the nobles who would become the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]] - to experiment and consort with various sources of power. This resulted in the creation of several sorcerous bloodlines. 

Over the course of the war, she became increasingly erratic, spiteful and paranoid, prompting her vassal houses, particularly the Tychonis, to begin a plot to remove her and install a new queen.

After the [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|attack]] on [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\| Rarquet]], the Dowager Queen vowed to lead [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\| the final assault]] into [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\| the Republic]]. She mustered her forces and placed them under the command of General [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\|Victoria Parcival]], and began the march on Cer'Dorei. 

Unbeknownst to her, she had been poisoned gradually by the Tychonis. She dies halfway to the capital of the Republic. After her death, the war council crowns Victoria as her replacement.
