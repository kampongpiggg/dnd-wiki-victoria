**Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton** was the dowager queen of [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\| Alastia]] and the mother of the late [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]], who was assassinated by elven assassins at the behest of [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| Senator Julian Yaeldrin]] and [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\| Chancellor Ovina Torunn]]. Her decision to seize the throne from her daughter-in-law [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]] was a catalytic event that led to [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]], a major multi-theater international conflict across the continent.

## Tension in the Court
After the ascension of [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] to the throne in 740 AY, the Dowager Queen began the search for a suitable queen consort for her son. While many of her [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\| vassal houses]] presented their daughters as possible suitors, Arthur went against the advice of his council and married a common half-elf he had met during his travels. This was a widely contentious move, not only because of the social class of Gwendolyn Maegyr, but also the growing resentment at elves who often saw themselves as a superior species. 

Against the wishes of the Dowager Queen, King Arthur insisted on his marriage to Gwendolyn, making her Queen Consort. This upset both the Dowager Queen and the vassal houses, leading to an undercurrent of tension in the court. Dowager Queen would often snipe at the Queen Gwendolyn with condescending remarks about her birth and class status.

## The Sundering War
###### A Crisis in Alastia
In 749 AY, after the death of [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]] at the hands of [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\|Vaxildan & Vexalia]], despite not being next in the line of succession, the Dowager Queen denied the throne to the rightful [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]] and seized power. This violated the laws of succession, resulting in international outrage. As an act of foreign intervention, the Imperator [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]] led the [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]] in an invasion into Alastia. 

###### The Siege of Dashund's Lea
When approached by Chancellor [[2. The World/People/Ovina Torunn\|Ovina Torunn]]'s envoys to buy automatons, the Dowager Queen agreed. The warforged was able to stall the advance of the Republic Legion outside Ryoko. In a risky gamble, the Imperator led his forces to [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|../Locations/Dashund's Lea]], capturing it after a [[2. The World/History/The Siege of Dashund's Lea\| two-day siege]]. 

The fall of Dashund's Lea resulted in the loss of a third of Alastian territories. The former rulers, House Tychonis, fled back to the capital. In a bid to break the Republic's upper hand, and as punishment for losing the city, the Dowager Queen forcefully exposed the young heir of the house the Lady Ymir Tychonis to the Shadowfell. The exposure supercharged her, imbuing her soul with powerful dark magic and turning her into the first sorcerer. The successful experimentation pushed the other vassal houses to join the experimentation, granting them [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\| various sorcerous abilities]].

###### The Fall of the Dowager Queen
By 754 AY, after the successful [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|Operation Chisel]] saw the surrender of [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\| Rarquet]], the possibility of the war coming to an end with an Alastian-Ophidian victory became imminent. However, over the course of the war, the Dowager Queen had become increasingly erratic, spiteful and paranoid. This prompted her vassal houses to begin a plot to remove her and install a new Queen.

To end the war, the Dowager Queen vowed to lead [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\| the final assault]] into [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\| the Republic]]. She mustered her forces under the command of General [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\|Victoria Parcival]], and began the march on Cer'Dorei. Unbeknownst to her, she had already been poisoned by the Tychonis. Halfway on the march to Nike, she took terribly ill and passed. When she dies along the journey, the war council crowns General Victoria as her replacement. 

## Legacy
The war resulted, by estimates, in the deaths of a third of the continent. With her death, she was succeeded by General Victoria Parcival as Queen of Alastia, an office that was subsequently abolished with the Concord.
