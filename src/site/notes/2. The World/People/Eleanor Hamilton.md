Dowager Queen Eleanor Hamilton was the dowager queen of [[The Kingdom of Alastia \| Alastia]] and the mother of the late [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\|Arthur Hamilton]], who was assassinated by elven assassins at the behest of [[Julian Yaeldrin \| Senator Julian Yaeldrin]] and [[Ovina Torunn \| Chancellor Ovina Torunn]]. 

Despite not being next in the line of succession and thus the rightful queen, she denied the throne to the rightful queen [[2. The World/People/Gwendolyn Hamilton\|Gwendolyn Hamilton]] and seized power. This prompted [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]], a major multi-theater international conflict across the continent.

During the War, seeking to gain an edge over her enemies, she pushed her vassal houses - the nobles who would become the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]] - to experiment and consort with various sources of power. This resulted in the creation of several sorcerous bloodlines. 

Over the course of the war, she became increasingly erratic, spiteful and paranoid, prompting her vassal houses, particularly the Tychonis, to begin a plot to remove her and install a new queen.

After the attack on [[The Rarquet Assembly \| Rarquet]], the Dowager Queen vowed to lead the final assault into [[The Cer'Dorei Republic \| the Republic]]. She mustered her forces and placed them under the command of [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\| General Victorian Parcival]], and began the march on Cer'Dorei. 

Unbeknownst to her, she had been poisoned gradually by the Tychonis. She dies halfway to the capital of the Republic. After her death, the war council crowns Victoria as her replacement.
