# Titles
Although colloquially addressed as the Victorian Emperor or Empress, the title of Emperor is actually officially stylized as **Concordant Emperor of the Nations of Victoria**. The ruler also holds the title **Guardian of the Realm** as the commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army, although this need not always be the case. In a regency where the appointed successor is under-aged, this title is often delegated to an appointed official.

Additional titles, approved by the [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\|Chamber of Lords-Advisory]], describing the great deeds of the Emperor may be conferred. 

The titles of the first Victorian Emperor, General [[2. The World/People/Victoria Parcival\|Victoria Parcival]], were officially:
1. Concordant Emperor of the Nations of Victoria,
2. Guardian of the Realm,
3. Architect of the Concord,
4. The Bolt of Coatlan, 
5. The Valkyrie of Syllamere,
6. Victor of the Sundering War
