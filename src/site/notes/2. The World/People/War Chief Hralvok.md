**War Chief Hralvok** is the tribal leader of [[2. The World/Organisations/Clan Ladon\|Clan Ladon]], the current governing body of [[2. The World/Locations/The Verdant Reach\| The Verdant Reach]]. He ascended to his station and unified the Reach during [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| the Sundering War]]. 

## Description
Having descended from black dragons, Hralvok possessed a sharp, elongated snout with black-and-grey toned scales. Heavily muscled with a thick neck and broad chest, Hralvok's massive arms were covered in intricate tribal tattoos.


## The Sundering War
In response to the sorcerous powers gained by the vassal houses of the Kingdom of Alastia, the Imperator Julian began sending diplomatic envoys into the Verdant Reach to treat with various beastfolk tribes to join the war. A coalition of tribes agreed, under the promise that the Cer'Dorei would send their well-trained legions to help them take control of the wild and fractured Reach. Organizing themselves under the Skald Qreqerr, these tribes began calling themselves [[2. The World/Organisations/The Russett Pride\| The Pride]].

Out of fear that they will be massacred after the Sundering War, Hralvok united the tribes in the Scorching Sands, bringing beastfolk of many different races into his dragonborn clan. They then allied themselves with Alastia, leading raiding parties into the Russett Jungle and Coatlan against the Pride and Republic forces.

During the battle outside Syllamere, Hralvok slays Qreqerr in single combat. The dragonborn was subsequently nominated as the leader of the Reach during the establishment of the Concord.
