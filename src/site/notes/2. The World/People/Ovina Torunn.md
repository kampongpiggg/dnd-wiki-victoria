**Chancellor Ovina Torunn** was a Chancellor of [[2. The World/Organisations/The High Syndicacy\| the High Syndicacy]] of [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\| the Rarquet Assembly]]. Popularly known as the Tin Vulture, she was a skilled manipulator and orchestrated the Alastian succession crisis via assassinations and rumours, effectively beginning the [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\|The Sundering War]].

## Early Life and Rise to Power
As a young dwarf, Ovina Torunn was a bright and intelligent girl brought up in The Smith's Reef. Her talent with steelworking and forging earned her a Citadel scholarship, which saw her move to Dunhammer for an artificer apprenticeship. In Dunhammer, she was trained by Darius Khorvaire, the guild leader of the Tin Titans.

A charismatic individual, her natural leadership saw her rise to power, taking over Darius Khorvaire as the leader of the guild and thus joining the council of guild leaders known as The High Syndicacy.

At some point after her rise to power, she took in the orphaned twins [[2. The World/People/Vaxildan & Vexalia\|Vaxildan & Vexalia]].

## The Sundering War
###### A Crisis in Alastia
It is unknown when she first met  [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\| the Senator Julian Yaeldrin]], or when the pair decided to orchestrate the assassination of [[2. The World/People/Arthur Hamilton\| the King of Alastia]]; but in 749 AY, her agents Vaxildan and Vexalia infiltrated [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\| the Kingdom of Alastia]] and assassinated the King. It was purported that the Chancellor sought to incite a war between the Kingdom and [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\| the Cer'Dorei Republic]] so as to increase sales of the automatons they produced. This would have increased her guild's profits, and thus her influence on the High Syndicacy.

After the outbreak of the war, Rarquet remained neutral, but was happy to supply weapons to both belligerents. Most in demand of all were Tin Titans' warforged automatons, which provided not only sufficient firepower but could absorb significant damage and prevent significant loss of life. Ovina sold these automatons to both sides. By 750 AY, Ovina was the most powerful member of the High Syndicacy, having generated the most amount of profit.

###### Attack on the Kryn Ward
In 752 AY, Alastia refused to buy more automatons, decrying Rarquet for being war profiteers. In response, Ovina sent Vexildan and Vexalia into Ophidia to [[2. The World/History/Attack on the Kryn Ward\| bomb the Kryn Ward]], in an attempt to draw [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\| the neutral country]] into war. While the attack was successful, her agents were caught and executed by Ophidia's [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Gold\| Ring of Gold]]. 

Ophidia's entry into the war led to the liberation of Coatlan and Ryoko, who at the time were held by the Cer'Dorei Republic. In response for the attack on the Kryn Ward, the Archmage [[2. The World/People/Felicity\|Felicity]] began planning a covert military operation known as [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|Operation Chisel]].

###### Operation Chisel & Death
In 754 AY, a coalition force consisting of [[2. The World/Organisations/Chamber of Lords-Advisory\| Alastian sorcerers]], the [[2. The World/Organisations/Ring of Silver\|Ring of Silver]] and the Ring of Gold began a simultaneous assault on forges and smiths integral to the supply of automatons to the Cer'Dorei Republic. 

Force Grey, led by the Archmage Felicity, assaulted the Citadel in a bid to capture or kill the Chancellor. The element of surprise allowed Force Grey to quickly break through many of the barriers, killing many Syndicacy agents. Alerted to their assault, Ovina refused surrender, fleeing into her secret workshop. When Force Grey finally arrived at the High Hall of the Citadel, Ovina erupted out in a massive mech suit, powered by the Ether.

The battle was long and brutal. Witnesses reported the fight spilling onto the streets of Dunhammer, until finally the Chancellor was crushed by a *Dark Star* spell.

## Legacy
After her death, the Rarquet Assembly exited the war. She was succeeded by Chancellor Eitri Lancaster, who represented Rarquet's interests in the negotiation of the Concord.
