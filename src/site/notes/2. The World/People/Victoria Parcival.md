General **Victoria Parcival** was a leader in the [[2. The World/Locations/The Kingdom of Alastia\| Alastian]] army and the first [[2. The World/People/The Victorian Emperor\| Victorian Emperor]]. Although she was born a commoner, her bravery during [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| The Sundering War]] earned her the respect and trust of many. Most notably, her gallant leadership in the Raid on Coatlan earned her the command of the coalition army in the final offensive against the Republic, where she defeated the Imperator [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]] in single combat outside [[2. The World/Locations/Syllamere\|Syllamere]].

## Early Life
Born to a pair of hawkers in Caliburn's Rock, Victoria Parcival had a tough childhood. Being a small girl, she was often picked on by bigger boys, who would often demand money or food from her. And yet, despite her disadvantage, Victoria would always refused to pay, often standing her ground and fighting them off. 

In 716 AY, while Victoria was once again involved in a fight against the bullies, another girl appeared and began defending her. Victoria and her rescuer struck the bullies fiercely, causing them to flee. The little girl introduced herself as Patli Xicoatl, the youngest daughter of House Xicoatl.

Patli and Victoria became inseparable; although House Xicoatl administered the city of Coatlan much further in the North, Patli was sent to the capital to seek an education in Caliburn's Rock. The two would often sneak off into carnivals and taverns, trying to get away from Patli's men-at-arms.

## The Sundering War 
###### The Siege of Dashund's Lea
After the fall of [[2. The World/Locations/Dashund's Lea\|Dashund's Lea]], the Dowager Queen [[2. The World/People/Eleanor Hamilton\|Eleanor Hamilton]] issued a conscription order, drafting an able-bodied member from each family in Alastia. Wanting to save her father, a poor peasant farmer, from the horrors of war, she enlisted in his place. 

Training was tough, but Victoria proved tougher. What she lacked in physical strength, she made up for in pure tenacity. Her refusal to give up and resilience earned her the respect of her comrades, who often looked to her for leadership. 

###### Raid on Coatlan
In 751 AY, while under the command of Sir Galahad Phillips defending the western front, Victoria went against her orders and led a raid into Coatlan, raiding the city and freeing the surviving members of House Xicoatl who had been held against their will by Cer'Dorei forces. While reprimanded, the operation was a critical success, earning her own command.

###### Diplomacy in the Reach
After [[2. The World/Organisations/The Russett Pride\|The Russett Pride]] joined [[2. The World/Locations/The Cer'Dorei Republic\|The Cer'Dorei Republic]], [[2. The World/Organisations/Clan Ladon\|Clan Ladon]] sought to enter the war to ensure their own survival. The newly promoted Captain Victoria Parcival was dispatched to negotiate terms with their leader [[2. The World/People/War Chief Hralvok\|War Chief Hralvok]], so as to bolster Alastian forces.

###### Liberation of Dashund's Lea, Coatlan and Ryoko
In 752 AY, after the attack on the Kryn Ward forced the entry of [[2. The World/Locations/Ophidia\|Ophidia]] into the war, a simultaneous attack was conducted on Dashund's Lea and Coatlan to liberate the cities. Ophidian forces led by the Archmage [[2. The World/People/Felicity\|Felicity]] attacked Coatlan, while Sir Galahad Phillips led Alastian forces in liberating Dashund's Lea. 

While both attacks succeeded, Sir Galahad Phillips unfortunately fell in battle against the Imperator [[2. The World/People/Julian Yaeldrin\|Julian Yaeldrin]]. Before his death, he named Victoria as his successor. Both armies assaulted Ryoko, liberating the city and pushing Cer'Dorei forces back into Republic lands.

###### The Battle outside Syllamere
After the successful execution of [[2. The World/History/Operation Chisel\|Operation Chisel]] saw the exit of [[2. The World/Locations/The Rarquet Assembly\|The Rarquet Assembly]] from the war, the Dowager Queen mustered her forces under General Victoria Parcival and began the march on Cer'Dorei.

Unbeknownst to them, House Luxjaro had already poisoned the Dowager Queen, seeking to replace her with someone less erratic, spiteful and paranoid. When the Dowager Queen eventually passed along the journey, the war council crowns Victoria as her replacement.

Before the battle, the two parties attempted to broker a peace. While the Imperator offered peace, Victoria refused terms, wanting to see him pay for inciting the war. Combat started at midday and lasted hours. In single combat, she slew the Imperator, decapitating him with a swift strike.
