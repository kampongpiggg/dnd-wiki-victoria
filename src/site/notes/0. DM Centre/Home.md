###### Three Truths about the World
1. **A World Shaped by War.** The world is set 35 years after the brutal [[2.

2. **Blending Science and Magic.** The world of Parvaterra is one where there is no distinction between science and magic; the gods themselves are ancient astronauts from a different, dead civilization and sought refuge in this new world.

Noble families empowered by sorcery dominated and regulate the economy, and by extension, regular life. Factions vie for power in the capital city of [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\|Leonitar]] through the art of politicking, each working against another in the shadows to further their own interests. Communities, and their internal prosperity and joy, shape the society's state: will the world become more dangerous by your actions, or will you forge a safer, more prosperous world.
