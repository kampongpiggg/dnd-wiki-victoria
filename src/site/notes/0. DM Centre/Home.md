Welcome! This wikipedia is an encyclopedic guide to the world of The Victorian Empire, our homebrew D&D campaign setting. It also serves as a record of the lore and shenanigans of our heroes as they go on adventures in this world.

###### Three Truths about the World
1. **A World Shaped by War.** The world is set 35 years after the brutal [[2. The World/History/The Sundering War\| The Sundering War]], a massive continental war that saw the great powers almost destroy each other. In its aftermath, a Concord was reached, where the five great nations banded together to form a powerful [[2. The World/Locations/The Victorian Empire\| Empire]].
2. **Blending Science and Magic.** The world of Parvaterra is one where there is no distinction between science and magic; the gods themselves are ancient astronauts from a different, dead civilization and sought refuge in this new world. The technology of this world has advanced quickly under the twin march of science and magic since the discovery of the powerful substance known as Ether, achieving Renaissance era technologies in less than 800 years.
3.  **Driven by Institutions.** Since the Sundering War, many institutions have risen as instruments of control. Noble families empowered by sorcery dominated and regulate the economy, and by extension, regular life. Factions vie for power in the capital city of [[2. The World/Locations/Leonitar\|Leonitar]] through the art of politicking, each working against another in the shadows to further their own interests. Communities, and their internal prosperity and joy, shape the society's state: will the world become more dangerous by your actions, or will you forge a safer, more prosperous world.
